## verse 22 - namas 55 & 56 - May 22 

सुमेरु-मध्य-श‍ृङ्गस्था - sumeru-madhya-śṛṅgasthā

From this nāma till 63, the narration of Her abode begins. Sumeru means in the midst of mountains called meru. She lives in the centre of Meru Mountains. Vāc Devis in nāma 52 said that Lalithambike is seated on the left thigh of Śiva - union of static and kinetic energies. Now they are discussing about her palace. Meru mountain range has three peaks and if a line is drawn connecting them, a triangle is formed. In the midst of this triangle there is a taller peak than the rest of the three where in Lalithambike resides. Sage Durvāsa in his master piece Lalithāstavaratna says “I salute the three peaks (the shorter ones) which are abodes of Brahma, Viṣṇu and Śiva. In the midst of these peaks, there is another peak much higher than the other three. The golden rays are beautifying this peak and I worship it.” Possibly this could be the description of Śrī Cakrā. In the middle of Śrī Cakrā there is a triangle and in the centre of this triangle there is dot called bindu in which Lalithambike lives with Her consort Mahā Kāmeśvara. Nāma 52 is the contemplation on this bindu (this will be covered again later in the LS)

श्रीमन्नगर-नायिका - śrīmannagara-nāyikā

She owns this auspicious and wealthy city called Śrī Nagara. There are two narrations about this Śrī Nagara. One is found in Durvasa’s Lalithāstavaratna and another in Rudra Yāmala (as told to Pārvatī by Śiva). The former says that Śrī Nagara was constructed by celestial architect Viśvakarma. Rudra Yāmala says that Śrī Nagara is in the midst of ocean of milk as an island called Ratnadvīpa (island formed out of precious gems). In the midst of Śrī Nagara there is another city called Śrī Vidya that is surrounded by twenty five walls, each wall representing a tattva. So, She is the queen of such a place, from where She performs all Her three acts of creation, etc.
