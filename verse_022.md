## 55. सुमेरु-मध्य-श‍ृङ्गस्था - sumeru-madhya-śṛṅgasthā

From this nāma till 63, the narration of Her abode begins. Sumeru means in the midst of mountains called meru. She lives in the centre of Meru Mountains. Vāc Devis in nāma 52 said that Lalithambike is seated on the left thigh of Śiva - union of static and kinetic energies. Now they are discussing about her palace. Meru mountain range has three peaks and if a line is drawn connecting them, a triangle is formed. In the midst of this triangle there is a taller peak than the rest of the three where in Lalithambike resides. Sage Durvāsa in his master piece Lalithāstavaratna says “I salute the three peaks (the shorter ones) which are abodes of Brahma, Viṣṇu and Śiva. In the midst of these peaks, there is another peak much higher than the other three. The golden rays are beautifying this peak and I worship it.” Possibly this could be the description of Śrī Cakrā. In the middle of Śrī Cakrā there is a triangle and in the centre of this triangle there is dot called bindu in which Lalithambike lives with Her consort Mahā Kāmeśvara. Nāma 52 is the contemplation on this bindu (this will be covered again later in the LS)

## 56. श्रीमन्नगर-नायिका - śrīmannagara-nāyikā

She owns this auspicious and wealthy city called Śrī Nagara. There are two narrations about this Śrī Nagara. One is found in Durvasa’s Lalithāstavaratna and another in Rudra Yāmala (as told to Pārvatī by Śiva). The former says that Śrī Nagara was constructed by celestial architect Viśvakarma. Rudra Yāmala says that Śrī Nagara is in the midst of ocean of milk as an island called Ratnadvīpa (island formed out of precious gems). In the midst of Śrī Nagara there is another city called Śrī Vidya that is surrounded by twenty five walls, each wall representing a tattva. So, She is the queen of such a place, from where She performs all Her three acts of creation, etc.

# Nama 57 & 58 - May 23 

## 57 चिन्तामणि-गृहान्तस्था - cintāmaṇi-gṛhāntasthā

She lives in a palace constructed out of Cintāmaṇi, one of the most valuable gems. This gem is supposed to give whatever is desired (the equivalent of Kamadhenu - the celestial cow) . This palace is on the northern side of Śrī Nagara, the city. All the gods and goddesses go to this place to worship Her. This is supposed to be the place of origin of all mantras. Worshipping this place eradicates all mental afflictions.

## 58.पञ्च-ब्रह्मासन-स्थिता - pañca-brahmāsana-sthitā

She is seated on a throne made up of five Brahmas. The five Brahmas are Brahma, Viṣhṇu, Rudra, Maheshwara and Sadāśiva . Each form represents different acts - creation, sustenance, disollution for Brahma, Vishnu & Rudra respectively.  Mahadeva (Gu) & Sadasiva (Ru) represent the Guru tatvam - which is also why we start one of the key invocation sloka with "सदा शिव समारमभां = sadā śiva samāramabhāṃ" . For fans of Dakshinamurthy Stotram, Lord Dakshinamurthy is the one who is referred to as Sadashiva. 

There is another interpretation for this Pancha-Brahma. This could possibly mean the basic elements - pancha boothas - Space, Air, Water, Fire & Earth. Lalithambike is sitting on these five elements, each element forming four legs of Her throne and one forming the seat. I have interpreted this nama to mean what Lord Krishna explains in Gita 7.04 as 5 out 8 aspects of apara prakriti (the other 3 being the cosmic mind, cosmic intellect and samashti avidya/ignorance) +  what Lord says in 7.05 where he highlights that in addition to these apara prakriti list there is the para prakriti which is called Brahman in the Upanishads.  This fits in nicely with the earlier namas Siva & Svadhina Vallabha where Lalithambike is defined as Brahman/Consciousness principle. Now the Divine Mother "sitting" on these 5 elements is to be taken as "blessing" or "pervading" and not the physical act of sitting.

Footnote 

for fans of Bhagavad Gita - If you want your mind blown on sloka 7.04 then I sincerely suggest you read Adi Shankaracharya's commentary on the sloka. It truly is a fascinating narration given how beautifully he breaks down the whole apara prakriti. Unfortunately there is no time or space to cover all that elaborate stuff here (the Advaitins agree vehemently 😀) but if you would like to read more, pls ping me privately.
