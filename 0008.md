# nama 8 / 1000 - Apr 14

रागस्वरूप-पाशाढ्या - rāgasvarūpa-pāśāḍhyā

This nama means - Holding the noose that helps pull desires. Here the word used to describe desire is Raga (Desire / Wish or Ichha). 

{Tamil speakers will note the connection of Lord Yama to Pasa கயிறு (Rope) - this is not as the Lord of Death but as the Guru who gave Nachiketha the Brahma Jnanam in Katho Upanishad acknowledging the young boy’s clear sense of discrimination between the Eternal v. Ephemeral} 

There are 3 saktis (Icha, Kriya and Jnana) and this nama refers to Icha Sakti . She will never allow Her devotees to sink or lose their ultimate purpose driven by pointless desires. This weapon she has in her lower left hand and is represented by Asvarudda Devi.

When Arjuna asks Krishna in the Gita as to what really traps a human into committing mistakes, the Lord responds  in Gita 3.37 - काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भव: - kāma eṣha krodha eṣha rajo-guṇa-samudbhavaḥ - The Lord replied – (It is) this desire. (It is) this anger. (It is) born of Rajōguṇa. (It is) insatiable and very sinful. Know this to be the enemy in this life. 

Every scripture pretty much says the same thing - We dont know that we are the Consciouness and somehow delude ourselves to think we are this body/mind. Once that mistake is done it is trouble and more trouble all the way as the sense of incompleteness (apurnatvam) never goes away even after any amount of money or wealth or possessions or relationships. And sense of incompleteness manifests itself in 2 ways - (1) wanting more and more for me & my family - the I,Me & Mine trap & (2) not wanting to share outside the selfish circle.  Specific namas will be used in LS later to define these 2 blunders. 

Adi Shankaracharya in his commentary on the Gita cannot be bothered to explain chap 1 and its gory details plus all of Arjuna’s glycerine theatrics. He simply summarises Arjuna’s problem in 4 words - aham ēṣām and mama ētē. I have a group of people and I claim those people as belonging to me and I claim myself as belonging to them. ahaṅkāra mamakāra saṅga is the root of all troubles, Acharya says.  It is said that the great singer M S Subbalakshmi was so deeply moved by the teachings of Adi Shankaracharya especially on the topic of our real identity and therefore the evil of desires that throughout her life she pretty much shared everything she had, and in her final weeks/months died penniless without  having much to even afford her diabetic medication.  While there may be a temptation to call her a ‘loser’ it would be worthwhile to pause to reflect if she was not the greatest “gainer” and what life lessons we may learn from her. Some of you who know the story of Janaka’s previous birth will appreciate this point better (attaching the link in case you have not heard this gut wrenching story by SPJi - https://youtu.be/UB5Lz3uXo_A) 

Therefore this nama higlights, for the right seeker (that we defined in nama 5), the Divine mother will use this rope and ensure the desires don't detract you from the real objective.  No prizes for guessing that the next nama will talk about another weapon in one of her hands which will address anger.

And straight away in as early as the 2nd verse LS swoops in like a Vulture on our 2 main problems that Lord Krishna identifies in the Gita.  The Divine Mother is not the one to waste time and beat around the bush. I am guessing she could focus better mostly because she did not have to undergo torture and wailing from the likes of Arjuna for one full chapter.  Admin only post groups have a distinct advantage even if they are somewhat Vladimir Putin-ish 🇷🇺 🫡 😀
