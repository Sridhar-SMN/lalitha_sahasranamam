45. पदद्वय-प्रभाजाल-पराकृत-सरोरुहा - padadvaya-prabhājāla-parākṛta-saroruhā 

## नख-दीधिति-संछन्न-नमज्जन-तमोगुणा  - nakha-dīdhiti-saṃchanna-namajjana-tamoguṇā

The rays of Her nails remove the ignorance of those who bow before Her. When Deva-s and asura-s (demons) pay their reverence to Her by bowing, the rays of the gems emanating from their crowns are in no comparison to the rays emanating from the nails of Her feet. The rays that come out of Her nails destroy the tamo guṇa (inertia) and ignorance of those who worship Her.

It is also said that She does not bless with Her hands, but with Her feet - refer footnote below . She does not have abhaya and varada hands. Normally one can notice that most of the Gods have four hands, out of which one is meant for blessings and another for giving boons. Lalitambike does not have these two hands as She has four powerful goddesses (nāma-s 8, 9, 10 and 11) in Her four hands and the 4 instruments we saw earlier. The two acts of blessings and granting boons are done by Her lotus feet.

## पदद्वय-प्रभाजाल-पराकृत-सरोरुहा - padadvaya-prabhājāla-parākṛta-saroruhā

The beauty of Her feet is much more than a lotus. Generally lotus flower is compared to the eyes and feet of gods and goddesses. In Saundarya Laharī (verse 2) says “Gathering tiniest speck of dust from your lotus feet, Brahma creates the worlds, Viṣṇu sustains them and Śiva pulverising them into ashes besmears His body with them.”

Footnote & the practice at Lalithambike temple at Thirumeychur

Given the Divine mother blesses with her toe nails and knowing most of us are sakami bakthas (asking for something or worse look at the Saree quality and Jewellery) our ancient rishis spun a story that the deity at Thirumeychur is an architectural wonder and has a gap in  the folded ankle where one can fix a Payal/ Anklets / கொலுசு. And true enough Anklets can go thru a small opening and magically fit the Divine Mother.  This has now assumed a life of its own and on a daily basis the temple gets hundreds of such Anklets in both silver and gold.   Now here is where the trouble begins - the idea was that in the guise of making the devotees offer an anklet to the Divine Mother that they will also somehow happen to see her toe nails and feet. But alas it has proved counter productive. Left alone atleast some of them would have looked at the feet and unknowingly at the toe nails. But that does not happen unless you have read nama 44 of LS and understood the meaning. The regular devotee is so enamoured that his Anklet fits the divine mother that he/she forgets the real purpose of this trick by our sages and everytime I have been at the temple there is always one chap narrating this Payal story that all get so entrapped in the story and the Payal that they forget the subtext. So next time you are at Thirumeychur, whether or not you take an anklet with you, remember to see Lalithambike's toe nails.  And if you observe closely during LS sahasranama archanai the panditji will offer kumkum onto to the toenails of the feet of the Lalithambike. 

Wishing all of you a blessed weekend. Next post on Asia Monday.
