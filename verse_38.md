Verse 38 - namas 99 & 100 - Aug 17 

## 99. मूलाधारैक-निलया - mūlādhāraika nilaya 

She resides in mūlādhāra cakra. Mūla means root and ādhāra means support. That is why mūlādhāra cakra is called the base (foundational) cakra. The most important point to note is how we interpret the word "She" - It is important that we learn from the last 37 verses and relate this to knowledge of our true nature as Atman/Nirguna Brahman. It is incorrect to say at Atman/Brahman/Consciousness resides in any place in the body given it is all pervading. Here "residing" should be seen figuratively as the key that unlocks the Granthi (knot) in the Muladhara Chakra. Divine grace, for the right seeker, always vests as Guru and Sastra Prapthi. Thru avantara vakyams (general description of Atman & Brahman in the scriptures) the seeker gets a decent indrect hang (paroksha jnanam) of the concept and thru the study and contemplation of Mahavakyam (Tat Tvam Asi) under the guidance of Guru (as Lord Krishna insists we do in Gita 4.34) the seeker gets the Aparoksha jnanam of Brahman. We will try to see what this Granthi symbolises in the next nama and how the knowledge of our real nature breaks thru this knot.

## 100. ब्रह्मग्रन्थि-विभेदिनी - brahmagranthi vibhēdinī

Residing in the Muladhara Chakra, the grace of the divine mother breaks open the Brahma Granthi. Brahma granthi at muladhara chakra, holds the consciousness entangled at the worldly level related to physical dimensions like sensuality or procreation, anxiety for survival and fear for lack of grounding. This is full blown expression of lack of completeness and it implies the entanglement with physical pleasures, material objects and excessive selfishness or a sense of fear (as lucidly captured by Lord Krishna in Gita slokas 2.62, 2.63 and 3.27). As Lord says in Gita 2.62 and 3.37 - the uncontrolled desire (which later morphs into anger) is the greates enemy as it keeps postponing contentment and keeps us eternally on the mode of accumulation which unknowingly transforms into hoarding. As Swami Sarvapriyananda says it cutely - even if you win the rate race you are still a rat. It also implies the overwhelming power of tamas – negativity, lethargy and ignorance. 

There is a lovely tamil proverb that captures this nama nicely - போதும் என்ற மனமே பொன் செய்யும் மருந்து - pothum enra maname pon ceyyum marunthu - A contented mind is a golden medicinal elixir or as another beautiful translation goes - enough is as good as a feast. 

Somewhere we need to draw a line on what is enough and the divine grace plus the intense longing to realise our already existing nature as completeness gets us to that point of contentment sooner.

Negative qualities driven by incompleteness act as hindrances and keep the Atman firmly tied to ignorance and this body/mind complex. ( it is symbollicaly referrred to in kundalini theory as the coiled snake rolled up in the base muladhara chakra). The grace of the Divine Mother (delivered thru Guru and Sastras) ensures this blockage is removed from the energy instincts of the deep rootedness with worldly affairs, material pursuits and the realm of consciousness gets awakened (and the trapped serpent power energy is released). The kundalini or primal energy is thus able to rise beyond mooldhara without bogged down by the attractions to which our consciousness is hooked - a less fancy way of saying this is state it as we dont look for external things, people, objects for validation of our completeness. On breaking open the Brahma granthi, the practitioner feels relaxed and enjoys bliss arising from the void (and even this is prathibimba ananda - joy of the atman reflected in the mind, but if i introduce all that complication here some of you may actually tie me with another big knot and then shoot me, so we will keep that torture for a later day)

## Advance prep for next 2 namas 

As you would have guessed situated in the Manipura Chakra the Divine Mother unties the Vishnu Granthi and situated in the Ajna Chakra She unties the Rudra Granthi. This will be covered in the next 4 namas. 2 slokas from our scriptures explain the state of the untying of these 2 granthis.  Simply means the elevated understanding of our own real nature helps us move closer to claiming our Atman status. Sending this ahead so you can browse thru. 

### Vishnu Granthi (the knot of needless accumulation and non sharing) 

One of the most famous slokas of the Gita (9.22) and its profound explanation by Adi Shankaracharya ties in nicely with this nama of LS.https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=9&field_nsutra_value=22&setgb=1&choose=1. When Shankarar says Sanyasa pls read it as internal sanyasa not orange robe.

### Rudra Granthi (the knot of envy) 

One of the most famous slokas from the Upanishad and according to Mahatma Gandhi if we lost all our scriptures but somehow managed to save this one sloka of the Isavasya Upanishad, we could easily resurrect the whole Sanatana Dharma https://shlokam.org/texts/ishavasya-1/ . We will cover Vishnu Granthi on Friday and Rudra Granthi on Monday

## 101. मणि-पूरान्तरुदिता - maṇipūrāntarudita- Aug 18

She is obtained/resides in manipura (navel) chakra. rest of the notes are same as nama 99.

## 102. विष्णुग्रन्थि-विभेदिनी - viṣṇugranthi vibhēdinī - Aug 18

Vishnu is the Lord of preservation and sustenance. When expressed as a "granthi - knot" it signfies excessive tendence to accumulate & hoard without sharing. The divine mother blesses the seeker with the right guru/scripture/knowledge that would be conduvice to the loosening of this knot. 

Explaining Gita sloka 9.22 - Swami P says the only person qualified to get "Yogakshemam" (as promised by the Lord in 9.22) is the Vidvat Sanyasi who has renounced everything and is 100% in Nidhidyasanam mode. One has to interpreet Adi Shankarachaya carefully as otherwise this may be interpreted as sanyasa ashram but a Vidvat Sanyasi is someone who has obtained adequate chitta shuddhi (purity of mind) thru Karma Yoga, decent levels of Chittha Ekagratha (concentration) by the practice of Saguna Ishwara/Ishta Devata Upasana and then having done adequate shravanam & mananam (listening and contemplation leading to a good understanding of Tat Tvam Asi) is now in nidhidhyasanam mode ready to kick out viparatee bhavana (habitual tendencies contrary to "I am Atman) from his/her mind thanks to a firm sankalpa and systematic & disciplined practice.

Pls read the advance notes i send yesterday for more details. Wishing all a blessed weekend.
