The concept of Granthi (knot) is classified into 3 types in the next 2 slokas - Brahma Granthi (not this is reference to Chatur Mukha Brahma and not Nirguna Brahman), Vishnu Granthi & Rudra Granthi.  The names are chosen to loosely draw reference from the roles of the trimurtis - creation, preservation & dissolution but used to express a negative reason why we the Atman are seemingly tied down by the Granthis to this body/mind. In all honesty, we can write pages and pages on this but the objective is not to bog you down with Vedantic concepts of dis-identification with anything which is not Atman related but more to give you a decent overview without glossing over the beauty of these namas in LS which talk about the breaking of these knots. In Viveka Chudamani, Adi Shankaracarya spends almost 150 verses (using pancha kosha viveka and sharira-trayam - Gross, Subtle and Causal) to breakdown the difference between Atman and Anathma (everything that is not Atman)

## 99. मूलाधारैक-निलया - mūlādhāraika nilayā - Aug 17

She resides in mūlādhāra cakra. Mūla means root and ādhāra means support. That is why mūlādhāra cakra is called the base (foundational) cakra. The most important point to note is how we interpret the word "She" - It is important that we learn from the last 37 verses and relate this to knowledge of our true nature as Atman/Nirguna Brahman.  It is incorrect to say at Atman/Brahman/Consciousness resides in any place in the body given it is all pervading. Here "residing" should be seen figuratively as the key that unlocks the Granthi (knot) in the Muladhara Chakra. Divine grace, for the right seeker, always vests as Guru and Sastra Prapthi. For those of you familiar with the Gajendra Moksha Stotram you will be able to relate better to this concept where Gajendra is fed up with the cycle of births and deaths (jijivishe as he says in verse 25 of GM) and screams for the Guru to releive him of this useless bondage. Thru avantara vakyams (general description of Atman & Brahman in the scriptures) the seeker gets a decent indrect hang (paroksha jnanam) of the concept and thru the study and contemplation of Mahavakyam (Tat Tvam Asi) under the guidance of Guru (as Lord Krishna insists we do in Gita 4.34) the seeker gets the Aparoksha jnanam of Brahman. We will try to see what this Granthi symbolises in the next nama and how the knowledge of our real nature breaks thru this knot.

Brahma granthi at muladhara chakra, holds the consciousness entangled at the worldly level related to physical dimensions like sensuality or procreation, anxiety for survival and fear for lack of grounding. This is full blown expression of lack of completeness and  it implies the entanglement with physical pleasures, material objects and excessive selfishness or a sense of fear (as lucidly captured by Lord Krishna in Gita slokas 2.62, 2.63 and 3.27). As Lord says in 2.62 and 3.37 - the uncontrolled desire (which later morphs into anger) is the greates enemy as it keeps postponing contentment and keeps us eternally on the mode of accumulation which unknowingly transforms into hoarding. As Swami Sarvapriyananda says it cutely - even if you win the rate race you are still a rat. It also implies the overwhelming power of tamas – negativity, lethargy and ignorance. There is a lovely tamil proverb that captures this nama nicely - போதும் என்ற மனமே பொன் செய்யும் மருந்து - pothum enra maname pon ceyyum marunthu - Contented mind is a golden medicinal elixir or as another beautiful translation goes - enough is as good as a feast. Somewhere we need to draw a line on what is enough and the divine grace plus the intense longing to realise our already existing completeness gets us to that point of contentment sooner. 

Negative qualities driven by incompleteness act as hindrances and keep the Atman firmly tied to ignorance and this body/mind complex. ( it is symbollicaly referrred to in kundalini theory as the coiled snake rolled up in the base muladhara chakra). The grace of the Divine Mother (delivered thru Guru and Sastras) ensures this blockage is removed from the energy instincts of the deep rootedness with worldly affairs, material pursuits and the realm of consciousness gets awakened (and the trapped serpent power energy is released). The kundalini or primal energy is thus able to rise beyond mooldhara  without bogged down by the attractions to which our consciousness is hooked - a less fancy way of saying this is state it as we dont look for external things, people, objects for validation of our completeness. On breaking open the Brahma granthi, the practitioner feels relaxed and enjoys bliss arising from the void (and even this is prathibimba ananda - joy of the atman reflected in the mind, but if i introduce all that complication here some of you may actually tie me with another big knot and then shoot me, so we will keep that torture for a later day) 

And yes a big hurray - We have completed 100 namas. Pls congratulate yourself for lasting with my torture for this long without succumbing to your urge to tear your hair out (where available) or worser outcomes. This itself should be enough to convince you that the divine mother is there to protect you.
