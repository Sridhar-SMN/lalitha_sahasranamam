The concept of Granthi (knot) is classified into 3 types in the next 2 slokas - Brahma Granthi (not this is reference to Chatur Mukha Brahma and not Nirguna Brahman), Vishnu Granthi & Rudra Granthi.  The names are chosen to loosely draw reference from the roles of the trimurtis - creation, preservation & dissolution but used to express a negative reason why we the Atman are seemingly tied down by the Granthis to this body/mind. In all honesty, we can write pages and pages on this but the objective is not to bog you down with Vedantic concepts of dis-identification with anything which is not Atman related but more to give you a decent overview without glossing over the beauty of these namas in LS which talk about the breaking of these knots. In Viveka Chudamani, Adi Shankaracarya spends almost 150 verses (using pancha kosha viveka and sharira-trayam - Gross, Subtle and Causal) to breakdown the difference between Atman and Anathma (everything that is not Atman)

## 99. मूलाधारैक-निलया - mūlādhāraika nilayā - Aug 17

She resides in mūlādhāra cakra. Mūla means root and ādhāra means support. That is why mūlādhāra cakra is called the base (foundational) cakra. The most important point to note is how we interpret the word "She" - It is important that we learn from the last 37 verses and relate this to knowledge of our true nature as Atman/Nirguna Brahman.  It is incorrect to say at Atman/Brahman/Consciousness resides in any place in the body given it is all pervading. Here "residing" should be seen figuratively as the key that unlocks the Granthi (knot) in the Muladhara Chakra. Divine grace, for the right seeker, always vests as Guru and Sastra Prapthi. For those of you familiar with the Gajendra Moksha Stotram you will be able to relate better to this concept where Gajendra is fed up with the cycle of births and deaths (jijivishe as he says in verse 25 of GM) and screams for the Guru to releive him of this useless bondage. Thru avantara vakyams (general description of Atman & Brahman in the scriptures) the seeker gets a decent indrect hang (paroksha jnanam) of the concept and thru the study and contemplation of Mahavakyam (Tat Tvam Asi) under the guidance of Guru (as Lord Krishna insists we do in Gita 4.34) the seeker gets the Aparoksha jnanam of Brahman. We will try to see what this Granthi symbolises in the next nama and how the knowledge of our real nature breaks thru this knot.

Brahma granthi at muladhara chakra, holds the consciousness entangled at the worldly level related to physical dimensions like sensuality or procreation, anxiety for survival and fear for lack of grounding. This is full blown expression of lack of completeness and  it implies the entanglement with physical pleasures, material objects and excessive selfishness or a sense of fear (as lucidly captured by Lord Krishna in Gita slokas 2.62, 2.63 and 3.27). It also implies the overwhelming power of tamas – negativity, lethargy and ignorance. Such negative qualities act as hindrances and keep the Atman firmly tied to ignorance and this body/mind complex. ( it is symbollicaly referrred to in kundalini theory as the coiled snake rolled up in the base chakra). The grace of the Divine Mother (delivered thru Guru and Sastras) ensures this blockage is removed from the energy instincts of the deep rootedness with worldly affairs, the realm of consciousness gets awakened (and the trapped serpent power energy is released). The kundalini or primal energy is thus able to rise beyond mooldhara  without bogged down by the attractions to which our consciousness is hooked - a less fancy way of saying this is state it as we dont look for external things, people, objects for validation of our completeness. On breaking open the Brahma granthi, the practitioner feels relaxed and enjoys bliss arising from void (and even this is prathibimba ananda of the atman reflected in the mind, but if i introduce all that complication here some of you may actually tie me with another big knot and then shoot me, so we will keep that torture for a later day)
