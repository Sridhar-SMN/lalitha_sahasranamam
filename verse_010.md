She shines with her two rows of teeth in the form of the bud of pure knowledge. Her teeth appear like Śuddha-vidyā (pure jnanam), which is reference to the concept of  Śrī Vidyā ### . Śrī Vidyā is considered as the most secret, sacred  and powerful ritual worship of Lalitāmbikā. This involves a lot of rituals and each ritual has its own meaning and interpretation. Śuddha means pure, vidyā means knowledge and Śuddha-vidyā means pure knowledge. This is considered pure because this upāsana mārg (Śrī Vidyā worshippers) emphasize  non-duality - Advaita, ‘I am That’ concept.


कर्पूर-वीटिकामोद-समाकर्षि-दिगन्तरा - karpūra-vīṭikāmoda-samākarṣi-digantarā

Karpūravītikā is a combination of fragrant ingredients, used to chew along with the betel leaves. The ingredients used are – saffron, cardamom, clove, camphor, kastūri, nutmeg and mace . The ingredients are finely powdered and mixed with powdered sugar candy. This Karpūravītikā powder when used with betel leaves for chewing gives immense fragrance and delicious taste. When She chews this, it provides fragrance to the entire universe. Here fragrance is to be interpreted not just as a sweet smell but the divine pull of the Goddess on the human minds turning them from ignorance towards knowledge.

Footnote 

###

 {Thirupugazh experts will note these lines in the famous song - முத்தைத்தரு பத்தித் திருநகை * - muththaiththaru paththith thirunakai aththikkiRai :  You are the Consort of DEvayAnai with a beautiful smile and lovely teeth looking like pearls  - Same meaning when reference is made to the teeth in that song and here. The topic of Sri Vidya Upasana is too deep and involved and I have to admit ignorance and only know enough to say  that it focuses on  contemplation of the Divine Mother as oneself and pushing the mind towards uninterrupted Brahmakara Vrittti }

it also happens to be a favorite song of many in this group captured in this beautiful rendition by Sivasri -https://youtube.com/shorts/bzhXflPY6tE?feature=share
