## 88. मूल-मन्त्रात्मिका - mūla-mantrātmikā - Aug 9 

Mūla means root. Mūlamantra means root of the mantra. Mantra here means Pañcadaśī. She is the root of the Pañcadaśī mantra, which is the root of all other mantras. In fact, Her kāmakalā is the root of Pañcadaśī mantra, which is discussed in nāma 322. As we saw in the last 3 namas, the Pañcadaśī mantra is superimposed on Her physical form.

## 89. मूलकूटत्रय-कलेबरा - mūlakūṭatraya-kalebarā - Aug 9 

The three divisions of the root (Mantra) form her body. The three divisions of the Mantra may be taken as forming either her physical or her subtle form. The word mula (of the previous and this nama) means the subtler body called Kamakala. The three divisions " are the parts of Kämakala. The first part of the Kämakala is (called) Urdhva- bindu (one bindu at the top), the next is two crossed
bindus and the lowest is called härdakala. These three in order take the form of the three groups of the fifteen- syllabled mantra as well as the face and other parts (face, throat to waist and down the waist) of the physical form (of Devi). The agamas explain this and the preceding name to indicate the subtler form of Devi, in her collective and individual aspects. In a nutshell, kāmakalā is the union of haṃsa and sohaṁ (haṃsa mantra – referring to the universal and the individual). There is a much deeper interpretation of Soham which we will see when we cover the Nirguna Brahman section. 

## 90. कुलामृतैक-रसिका - kulāmṛtaika-rasikā - Aug 10 

From this nama onwards till 111, the subtlest form of Lalithambike will be discussed. Her subtle form is mantra form, either Pañcadaśī or ṣodaśī, Her subtler form is kāmakalā form and Her subtlest form is kuṇḍalinī.  Detailed descriptions of each cakras expanding on the Kundalini are mentioned in nāmas from 475 to 534 (Om Swami has a very good book on just these namas. personally though i did not get much from the book but he has taken great pains to explain these cakras and namas.  this will come from sloka 99 onwards and if you are one of these keen on cakras and kundalini etc pls try to get hold of his book and read thru). 

The real meaning though is Kula means a triad (it is called triputi, meaning three words that leads to a single goal.) In this case knower, known and knowledge are known as a triad. Knower is the sadhaka, knowledge is the path that leads the sadhaka to the known and known is Lalithambike. There should be no difference between these three and this knowledge alone leads to self-realization. At this stage, the duality ceases to exist and non-duality dawns.  We will see more details of this in subsequent namas.

## 91. कुलसंकेत-पालिनी - kulasaṃketa-pālinī - Aug 11

She guards the secrecy of the kula or the family of Her worshippers. Everything that belongs to Her is highly secretive in nature. For example Her Pañcadaśī and ṣodaśī mantras, Her kāmakalā form, Her kuṇḍalinī form, the ritual worship called navāvarana pūja etc. I am somewhat aware that there is some mysticism surrounding these mantras and the tantric practices but beyond that I dont know much.  

I personally though would like to use Adi Shankaracharya's  way of interpreting and will use Gita 9.02 where the Lord says 

राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम् | प्रत्यक्षावगमं धर्म्यं सुसुखं कर्तुमव्ययम् || 
rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ pavitram idam uttamam, pratyakṣhāvagamaṁ dharmyaṁ su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam

I would like to draw our focus on the word राजगुह्यं - raja-guhyam (the king of secrets) as use Swami P's commentary to explain. 

Śaṅkarācārya doesn‟t explain why it is secret, we already know because of the well known Kaṭhōpaniṣat verse śravaṇāyāpi bahurabhiryō na labhyaḥ (many dont even know what is Brahman and even those who listen dont get the concept) which Lord Krishna uses to lament and express his frustration in Gita sloka 7.03 

Many people are not interested in vēdānta itself, even among those who are interested very few people get opportunity to listen and even among the listeners very few people manage to understand. Three levels - 33% say all this Brahman/Atman mumbo-jumbo is neither sensible or practical, another 33% says it is sensible but not practical; yet another 33% it is sensible and practical but dont think it will work for me.  So that leaves us with 1% and all Vedanta teachers know they are in the minority but then better than Lord Krishna who had only one student which is probably why he periodically needs to call out saying Arjuna, Kauntenya, Mahabaho etc to ensure the chap has not gone to sleep or something. Many are not interested and among the interested many don‟t get an opportunity to listen and among the listeners many don‟t understand. Therefore ultimately the number of people who come to vēdānta and who get an opportunity and who manage to understand after three layers of filtering how many will be there? Very few. Therefore it is called secret known by very very few and only by the grace of the divine mother does one get both interest and the right guru.  To that extent she is the protector of this knowledge and is not available to unqualified persons.

a hilarious episode narrated by Swami P during one of his visits for Biksha which highlights the uniqueness and difficulty of this knowledge of the Atman. I am quoting it verbatim in first person and have typed out as close to the way he explains stories.  so pls read it aloud for full effect thinking you are Swami P

"I went to a devotee/s house for biksha and after food they showed me their Pooja room. Amongst many pictures my picture was also there . But to my shock i saw a big halo 😇 behind my head. I was shocked because I brush my teeth daily and I never see any blue circle in the mirror so was wondering and I asked them how and where this picture was taken.

To which they replied that Swamiji it is regular picture only but we gave 20 rupees to a painter in Mylapore (a place in chennai) and he drew this circle and then framed it for us. And here I am thinking even after 20 years many students don’t understand Vedanta but for 20 rupees they can get a halo 😀
