Mūla means root. Mūlamantra means root of the mantra. Mantra here means Pañcadaśī. She is the root of the Pañcadaśī mantra, which is the root of all other mantras. In fact, Her kāmakalā is the root of Pañcadaśī mantra, which is discussed in nāma 322. As we saw in the last 3 namas, the Pañcadaśī mantra is superimposed on Her physical form.

The three divisions of the root (Mantra) form her body. The three divisions of the Mantra may be taken as forming either her physical or her subtle form. The word mula (of the previous and this nama) means the subtler body called Kamakala. The three divisions " are the parts of Kämakala. The first part of the Kämakala is (called) Urdhva- bindu (one bindu at the top), the next is two crossed
bindus and the lowest is called härdakala. These three in order take the form of the three groups of the fifteen- syllabled mantra as well as the face and other parts (face, throat to waist and down the waist) of the physical form (of Devi). The agamas explain this and the preceding name to indicate the subtler form of Devi, in her collective and individual aspects. In a nutshell, kāmakalā is the union of haṃsa and sohaṁ (haṃsa mantra – referring to the universal and the individual). There is a much deeper interpretation of Soham which we will see when we cover the Nirguna Brahman section.
