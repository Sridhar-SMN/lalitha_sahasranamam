## पद्मराग-शिलादर्श-परिभावि-कपोलभूः. - padmarāga-śilādarśa-paribhāvi-kapolabhūḥ

Her cheeks are shining, soft and reflecting. Padmarāga is a type of ruby, red in colour. Ruby is of four types: vipra, kuruvinda, saugandhika and mansa-khanda, out of which vipra is superior. Her cheeks are reflecting red colour as Her complexion itself is red. The other ornaments that have been described above are also red in colour. The sun and the moon in Her ear lobes make Her cheeks shining red. Everything associated with Her is red. As discussed earlier, red indicates compassion. 

## नवविद्रुम-बिम्बश्री-न्यक्कारि-रदनच्छदा  - navavidruma-bimbaśrī-nyakkāri-radanacchadā

Her lips outshine fresh coral and the bimba fruit (momordica monadelpha). Bimba fruit is normally compared to beautiful lips. Both are red in colour.

I am sure the Chinese will take to Lalithambike worship if they start seeing so many references to RED.  probably time to set the cat amongst the pigeons and see what happens, but knowing them they will probably cook both and eat so need to think of some other idiom and a novel way to pull them in.  Imagine in a few years many Chinese are chanting LS .. divine mother will be super shiok  ! 

Wishing all a blessed weekend. Next post on Asia Monday.
