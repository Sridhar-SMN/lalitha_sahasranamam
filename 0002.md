While the first nama referred to the divine mother as the creator, this nama brings out the Goddess as the sustainer.  You will note the "Sri" prefix continues here too.  The concept mentioned here is very similar to the concept of creator, sustainer in Gita slokas 9.04 to 9.08.  We will use those principles for a later nama. 

Essentially that as Brahman or Para Prakriti, the Divine mother in her higher nature is the sustainer/Adhistanam of the Mithya Universe.  Or if you take the Dvaita traditions then as the Sustainer the Divine Mother is the provider to all and as the Ishwara tatvam is the ultimate source of all support, benevolence and grace. 

Personally i like to believe in this body/mind complex it is worthwhile and sensible to surrender to the Divine mother thanking 'Her‚Äô for blessing us this apara prakriti and the prarabdh of this birth, while praying to the same Goddess to guide us in this very birth to help us understand the non-dual truth.  Swami P quotes this regularly to highlight the brilliance of Adi Shankaracharya - in Annapoorna Stotram which is the prayer to the Divine Mother as the sustainer (provider of food and nourishment) what do you think is the final prayer with which Acharya ends the Stotram ?

O Mother Annapoorna, You Who are always Full (with the gift of Food and Blessings), You Who are the Beloved of Shiva, O Mother Parvati, Please grant me the Alms of Your Grace, to awaken within me Spiritual Knowledge and Freedom from all Worldly Desires. 

Adi Shankaracharya will not miss a single opportunity to request divine mother‚Äôs grace to entrench Jnanam and Vairagyam.  He ends the Kanakadhara Stotram with a similar prayer. Just sublimely brilliant. 

From the Saguna Brahman/Ishwara /Deity angle there is a very nice interpretation of this nama.  If you notice it is Maharajni (Empress) and not Maharani (Queen).  My historical facts on this are not great but it is said that Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple was the first temple where the divine mother's Maharajni (Empress) status was correctly captured and She was given an independent sannidhi.  I don‚Äôt exactly know the date of origin of the temple at Thirumeychur (where also the Divine Mother Lalithambike has an independent Sannidhi) but more sure that the Madurai temple was constructed with this principle in mind. Later in LS the Goddess will be referred to as "Svathantra" which gets interpreted as not dependent on anything/anyone for support - the support-less supporter of the Universe - we can borrow that concept here to explain "Empress/Maharajni" of this nama.

SPji answering this and is at his quintessential best in this audio and he is not even speaking about Advaita Vedanta üòä
