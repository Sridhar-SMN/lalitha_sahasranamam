चिदग्नि-कुण्ड-सम्भूता - cidagni-kuṇḍa-sambhūtā

Cit+Agnikunda+Sambuta : Cit= Consciousness (Nirguna Brahman - Original Consciousness - OC), Agni Kunda = Fire altar & Sambuta = Born. This nama has some parallels to Gita sloka 4.37 where Lord Krishna talks about how knowledge of our real nature burns to ashes our ignorance, karma & kartritva (doership). 

Divine mother is the Supreme  Consciousness who dispels ignorance about our true nature.  The whole premise of the Upanishads is we don't know our real nature as Consciousness and somehow have managed to delude ourselves to thinking we are mainly this body/mind which is also conscious somehow. 

Upanishads, Gita and several scriptures like LS are hoping to try to make us flip our perspective on its head.  For the right seeker (or qualified adhikari as Vedanta likes to call it), the divine mother in her higher nature as Chit or Cit, illumininates from within dispelling this ignorance.  Here Sambutha=Born should not be taken in the literal sense that Consciousness is "born" along with birth of the body or somehow Brahman will appear at the moment of Self Realisation and dance in front of our eyes, but to be taken more as "available always even when the body does not exist (Gita 2.20) and also in the mind". Even using the word “always” is wrong usage as it somehow naively suggests Consciousness is bound within some definition of time, but you get the drift of what I am trying to say. 

The Brahmanda Purana (the Purana in which Lalitha Sahasranamam appears as the conversation between Lord Hayagriva and Sage Agasthya) has a beautiful imagery and story to capture this nama.  The Purana  after describing how Indra was persecuted by Bhandäsursa (more on Bhandasura when we discuss verse 31 onwards) , says: "Then he constructed a very beautiful sacrificial altar (agni kunda) and the Devas offered the flesh of their body as oblations (equatable to offering our actions and our mind to the Divine mother - arpan buddhi and prasad buddhi). When the Devas were about to offer up the whole of their bodies there appeared a great blaze of light, bright as millions of suns and cool as millions of moons put together (Consciousness is self revealing into the purified mind of the seeker); in the midst of this light was seen an indescribable wheel-form of Sricakra and from its centre arose the great Devi shining like the morning sun (I dont know for sure if this has any connection to the blaze of light that is described in Keno Upanishad where again the Divine mother schools Indra and gives him Atma Jnanam).  On beholding the great Devi, the Consciousness of all which now stood self revelaed, Indra and the Devas were filled with ecstasy and they bowed down to her again and again."
