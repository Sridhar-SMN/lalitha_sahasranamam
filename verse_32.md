## 80. कराङ्गुलि-नखोत्पन्न-नारायण-दशाकृतिः - karāṅguli-nakhotpanna-nārāyaṇa-daśākṛtiḥ - July 31

The popular explanation of this nama is "From the nails of her (ten) fingers sprang the ten forms of Närayana. Nails, joints of the mails, or finger tips. Ten forms (Dasa +Akrtih) of Narāyana are the ten incarnations of Vishnu, wiz., Fish, Tortoise, Boar, Man-lion, Dwarf, Parasurama, Rama, Balarama, Krsna and Kalki. In the context of the position in the LS and the previous nama on Ganesha and how he removes obstacles and destroying the army of Bhandasura etc this interpretation makes sense and also somewhat in line with what Lord Krishna says in the Gita in sloka 4.07 

यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत |
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ||
(Whenever there is a decline in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness, O Arjun, at that time I manifest Myself on earth) 

the whole avatara theory is well explained in the 4th chapter of the Gita by the Lord to highlight not just the role but to show that Lord as an avatara is beyond Maya and is not controlled by Maya. 

The other plausible explanation using the creation theory of Sankhya philosophy which Lord Krishna explains in Gita sloka 7.05 is this refers to 5 principles of Subtle elements which come out of Maya (Sukshma Bhutani) and/or the pancha koshas of the Jiva. Dasa Akritih means Ten forms and the above accounts for five.  The remaining 5 is believed to be the 5 functions of Ishwara (Saguna Brahman) the pancha krityas - Srishti, the creative act; sthiti, the protective act; samhara, the destructive act; tirodhana, the act of enfolding or concealing His nature; and anugraha, the act of unfolding or revealing His nature represented by Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Mahadeva & Sadashiva.  This interpretation also makes adequate sense as it shows ignorance as depicted by the whole created world including the Jiva and the role of Ishwara as the Guru (Sadashiva - which is also why the popular sloka starts as Sadashiva Samarambham, Shankaracharya Madhyamam....)  in unraveling the mystery by giving us the right knowledge. 

In the second explanation the only word left to be explained is Narayana and thankfully we have Swami P for being able to throw light on any question - Explaining Narayana he states it "Narasya ayanam iti Narayana - that consciousness pricinple which is the adhistanam/substratum of all Jivas) . So the 10 das akritis are the 5 subtle elements/5 koshas, 5 acts of Ishwara and Narayana is the Nirguna Brahman - Consciousness principle. 

My own addition as to why all this is explained using the nails is probably to depict the Asagah nature of the Supreme Brahman/Atman we are and nails are the perfect representation of detachment as whatever we do to them does not affect us one bit.  Otherwise imagine going thru intense pain everytime we sit down to trim our nails. Maybe the suggestion here is treat this body/mind/world similar to nail - use it but dont get too carried away thinking anything happening to the nail (growing, shaping, cutting, breaking etc) affects You even though you are intimately connected to the nail.  This last para is my crazy thought so pls dont sue me.

## 81. महा-पाशुपतास्त्राग्नि-निर्दग्धासुर-सैनिका - mahā-pāśupatāstrāgni-nirdagdhāsura-sainikā

The fire of Mahapâsupata weapons, the highest mental modifications connected with non-duality, which arise progressively according to the progressive practice (of the devotion). If you notice the word "agni" (fire) here refers to the fire of knowledge and as such the destruction of the internal enemeies who all add up to ignorance of real nature. The Mahapasupata mantra is said to the "Om Namah Shivaya received from and offered back to Lord Sadashiva (represented by Lord Dakshinamurthy). We have seen the detailed meaning of this mantra on May 18th under verse 21/nama 53. Pls refer back for details of what this implies and signifies.

The first line of Avadhuta Gita says - ishvaranugrahad-eva pumsam advaita vasana = Truly, it is by the grace of God
That the knowledge of Unity arises within

Why go even that far when we have our favorite Lord Krishna to convey they same point so beautifully in BG 10.11 

तेषामेवानुकम्पार्थमहमज्ञानजं तम: | नाशयाम्यात्मभावस्थो ज्ञानदीपेन भास्वता ||
teṣhām evānukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ |nāśhayāmyātma-bhāva-stho jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā ||

Adi Shankaracharya's commentary on this sloka is one for the ages - Anukampartham, out of compassion; tesam eva, for them alone, anxious as to how they may have bliss; aham, I; atmabhavasthah, residing in their hearts-atmabhavah means the seat that is the heart; being seated there itself; nasayami, destroy; tamah, the darkness; ajnanajam, born of ignorance, originating from non-discrimination, the darkness of delusion known as false comprehension; jnana-dipena, with the lamp of Knowledge, in the form of discriminating comprehension; i.e. bhasvata, with the luminous lamp of Knowledge-fed by the oil of divine grace resulting from devotion, fanned by the wind of intensity of meditation on Me, having the wick of the intellect imbued with the impressions arising from such disciplines as celibacy etc., in the receptacle of the detached mind, placed in the windless shelter of the mind withdrawn from objects and untainted by likes and dislikes, and made luminous by full Illumination resulting from the practice of constant concentration and meditation.

#### Essentially this nama says the same as BG 10.11 that the Divine Mother will light the lamp of knowledge in our minds (later in one nama we will see the divine mother is the thought, the illuminer of the thought and the thinker)
