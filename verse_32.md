The popular explanation of this nama is "From the nails of her (ten) fingers sprang the ten forms of Närayana. Nails, joints of the mails, or finger tips. Ten forms (Dasa +Akrtih) of Narāyana are the ten incarnations of Vishnu, wiz., Fish, Tortoise, Boar, Man-lion, Dwarf, Parasurama, Rama, Balarama, Krsna and Kalki. In the context of the position in the LS and the previous nama on Ganesha and how he removes obstacles and destroying the army of Bhandasura etc this interpretation makes sense and also somewhat in line with what Lord Krishna says in the Gita in sloka 4.07 

यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत |
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ||
(Whenever there is a decline in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness, O Arjun, at that time I manifest Myself on earth) 

the whole avatara theory is well explained in the 4th chapter of the Gita by the Lord to highlight not just the role but to show that Lord as an avatara is beyond Maya and is not controlled by Maya. 

The other plausible explanation using the creation theory of Sankhya philosophy which Lord Krishna explains in Gita sloka 7.05 is this refers to 5 principles of Subtle elements which come out of Maya (Sukshma Bhutani) and/or the pancha koshas of the Jiva. Dasa Akritih means Ten forms and the above accounts for five.  The remaining 5 is believed to be the 5 functions of Ishwara (Saguna Brahman) the pancha krityas - Srishti, the creative act; sthiti, the protective act; samhara, the destructive act; tirodhana, the act of enfolding or concealing His nature; and anugraha, the act of unfolding or revealing His nature represented by Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Mahadeva & Sadashiva.  This interpretation also makes adequate sense as it shows ignorance as depicted by the whole created world including the Jiva and the role of Ishwara as the Guru (Sadashiva - which is also why the popular sloka starts as Sadashiva Samarambham, Shankaracharya Madhyamam....)  in unraveling the mystery by giving us the right knowledge. 

In the second explanation the only word left to be explained is Narayana and thankfully we have Swami P for being able to throw light on any question - Explaining Narayana he states it "Narasya ayanam iti Narayana - that consciousness pricinple which is the adhistanam/substratum of all Jivas) . So the 10 das akritis are the 5 subtle elements/5 koshas, 5 acts of Ishwara and Narayana is the Nirguna Brahman - Consciousness principle. 

My own addition as to why all this is explained using the nails is probably to depict the Asagah nature of the Supreme Brahman/Atman we are and nails are the perfect representation of detachment as whatever we do to them does not affect us one bit.  Otherwise imagine going thru intense pain everytime we sit down to trim our nails. Maybe the suggestion here is treat this body/mind/world similar to nail - use it but dont get too carried away thinking anything happening to the nail (growing, shaping, cutting, breaking etc) affects You even though you are intimately connected to the nail.  This last para is my crazy thought so pls dont sue me.
