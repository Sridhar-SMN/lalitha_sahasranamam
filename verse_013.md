कनकाङ्गद-केयूर-कमनीय-भुजान्विता - kanakāṅgada-keyūra-kamanīya-bhujānvitā

kanaka – golden; aṅgada – bangles or bracelets; keyūra is a type of ornament worn in the upper arms. She is wearing these ornaments. Possibly, this could mean the following -  Both these ornaments are made out of gold and worn in the arms. Though they differ in form, the ingredient reality gold is the same in both and these are merely name and form of Gold. Though the forms of living beings are different, the innermost reality - Brahman remains the same. Gita 4.24 matches nicely to this nama. 

रत्नग्रैवेय-चिन्ताक-लोल-मुक्ता-फलान्विता - ratnagraiveya-cintāka-lola-muktā-phalānvitā

She is wearing a gems embedded golden pendent and a pearl necklace. These ornaments are dangling in Her neck. 

The dangling of these ornaments is compared to the mind. Those who are not capable of meditating on Her full form (head to foot) are said to be low class devotees and called as Lolas. Those who meditate (cintāka) on the throat (Griva) alone are called Graveyacintakas, i.e., they who cannot fix the deity in the cavity of the heart, but worship her externally are the middle class of worshippers.  Those who are able to meditate on Her full form (higher + lower from understanding both Her Nirguna and Saguna roopam) are said to be high class devotees and called as muktās (reference here is drawn to Gita 9.11 where Lord says those who are focused only his form are Moodas (fools) as they are not able to understand the need to contemplate on both his higher and lower nature) .

Lolas or Grivas or Muktās get the benefits (pala) of their prayers according to their category. This is the meaning of lola- muktā-palānvitā. While worshipping Her, one has keep to keep his mind steady & without distractions focused on her higher and lower nature ( pls go back to the namas that refer to instruments the divine mother is holding in her hands from verse 3 and 4 and do connect back to this)
