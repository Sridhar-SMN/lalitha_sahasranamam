## Nama 13 & 14/1000

## चम्पकाशोक-पुन्नाग-सौगन्धिक-लसत्कचा  : Campakāśoka-punnāga-saugandhika-lasat-kacā

Campaka, aśoka, punnāga, saugandhika are the four types of fragrant flowers that adorn Her hair. But Her hair does not get fragrance because of these flowers, whereas these flowers get their fragrance from Her hair. Her hair is always sweet smelling.  Wetness indicates Her compassion and softness indicates Her motherhood.

Sage Durvās in his ‘Śaktī Mahimna’ meditates on Her sweet smelling hair in his heart cakra. The idea behind these description is when Her hair can drive away ignorance (knowledge is considered as supreme in realising the Brahman), what Her total form can do for Her devotees. These four sweet smelling flowers mean the four deceptive components of antaḥkaraṇa viz. mind, intellect, consciousness and ego.

## कुरुविन्दमणि-श्रेणी-कनत्कोटीर-मण्डिता  :Kuruvinda-maṇiśreṇī-kanat-koṭīra-maṇḍitā :   (14)

Kuruvinda is a rare type of ruby, which is red in colour. This particular type of ruby is said to enhance love, wealth and devotion for Viṣṇu (Viṣṇu is Her brother). These rubies adorn Her crown. When She is meditated upon with this red crown, spirituality and prosperity will increase.
