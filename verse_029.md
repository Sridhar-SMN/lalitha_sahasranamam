She rejoices in the valour of Bala, (who was) ready to slay the sons of Bhanda.  The sons of Bhanda were thirty in number, viz. Caturbähu, to Upamaya. Bala a goddess nine years old. The Brahmanda Pr. says: "On hearing them, i.e., the exploits of the arms of her daughter, Devi was delighted."  I could not find the significance of the number thirty but I am willing to hazard a guess that is has something to do with the aspects of the gross and subtle body (karmendriyas, jnanendriyas, mind/intellect/memory/ahamkar, pancha boothas etc) . We will see this breakdown soon upon the birth of Lord Ganesha (even though there it only adds to 27) but dont think there is a need to split this ignornace thingy anymore than what we have already done. Basically everything that takes us away from our real nature is detrimental - dont think it matters if the count is 27 or 30 or 100.

Viśaṅga means desires arising out of the evil effects of sensory organs. Mantrinī Devi destroys such desires of the devotees of Lalithambike.  When discussing nama 69 on June 6 we saw how Mantrini Devi is the essence of all Mantras which ultimately lead the seeker towards realising the "I" consciousness within.  Here is where the value of naam-jaap or remembering the Lord's name is a useful tool in displacing sensory distractions. With the caution that quality is more important than quantity (so need to go numb in the fingers pressing that counter) and remembering both higher and lower nature of Lord, the blessings of Mantras (& Mantrini Devi) enables the rechanneling of the mind towards the undisturbed thought of the Self even amidst intense action.
