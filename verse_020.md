She is wearing anklets made out of precious gems that shine. It is to be noted that five namas 42 to 46 describe only about Her feet. When Her feet alone are described in such a detailed manner, it is beyond human comprehension to think about Her powerful form. This is made so by Vāc Devi-s, to impress about Her prākaśa vimarśa mahā māyā svarūpinī form.

## मराली-मन्दगमना - marālī-mandagamanā 

Her walking gait is like a female swan. When She comes out of the kunda (nāma 4) and walking towards gods and goddesses, Her gait is described like this. It always fascinates me that the gait of the Lord or Goddess has such significance especially in ancient poetry and compositions.  Saint Tyagaraja in his beautiful composition on Lord Krishna compares the Lord's gait to that of a big elephant.  Ramakrishna Murthy brings out the beauty of Tyagaraja's composition Samaja Vara Gamana in this fusion rendition - https://youtu.be/3QoDpiH8h1M 

## महालावण्य-शेवधिः - mahālāvaṇya-śevadhiḥ 

She is the treasure house of beauty. Saundarya Laharī (verse 12) says “The best of thinkers such as Brahma and others are at great pains to find a suitable comparison to your beauty. Even the celestial damsels, out of great eagerness to get a glimpse of your splendour, mentally attain a condition of absorption into Śiva, which is unobtainable even by penance.”
