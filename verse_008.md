कदम्बमञ्जरी-कॢप्त-कर्णपूर-मनोहरा :  kadambamañjarī-kḷpta-karṇapūra-manoharā

She is wearing the petals of kadhamba flowers in Her ears or flowers kept in Her hair flow down to Her ears. These flowers are grown outside Her Cintāmani graha (The palace where She lives). These flowers have divine fragrance, which is derived from Her ear lobes. 

There is a very famous scene from a Tamil movie Thiruvilayadal (the play of Lord Shiva) based on this very nama and for those of you who have visited Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple and know the movie will note that the climax of the first story in the movie (and use of this nama by Lord Shiva) with the revival of the ‘burnt to ashes Sage Nakkeran’  happens at the tank/pond you saw inside the temple. ###

ताटङ्क-युगली-भूत-तपनोडुप-मण्डला : tāṭaṅka-yugalī-bhūta-tapanoḍupa-maṇḍalā

She is wearing sun and moon as Her ear rings. This means She controls all the activities of the universe, as sun and moon are responsible for sustaining life. It is also said that sun and moon represent her eyes, earrings and bosoms.  

Most of you will have seen the example of Sun and Moon quoted in various scriptures (in the Gita it said to be the 2 eyes of the Lord (10.21) which is borrowed by Lord Krishna from Mundaka Upanishad 2.1.4 & in other places Sun represents eternity and Moon represents Time etc.) .  Most times this is to show the Vishwaroopa darshan of the Lord/Divine Mother.  Pls see footnote in case you want to be tortured more on Vishwaroopa Sagua Ishwara.

Footnote  (extracted from Swami P’s explanation of Mundaka Upanishad mantra 2.1.4)

Many people mistake 'viswarūpa as "one particular form" that appeared in front of Arjuna in the 11th chapter of Bhagavad Gita. There are photos also of that where one body is shown with so many divine heads stuck and a new controversy is created as to  which is the "main" head. viswarūpa is not a particular form. All the forms put together, is called "viswarupa". When is it available?  Pls dont say in the the 11th chapter Gita. Viswarupa is not in the 11th chapter of the Git but viswarupa is available for all the people, all the time, provided we look at the universe as the very manifestation of the Lord. If you look at 'the world as world', you are seeing the world. If you are seeing 'the world as the manifestation of God', which means there is an attitude of reverence towards the 'creation'. Reverential appreciation of the world is called is called viswarupa darśanam.

and for those of you who have not seen the Tamil movie, you are in luck. Here is the link with English subtitles. The story I mentioned starts at minute 36 in the YouTube video and runs upto 1hr 2 mins (26 mins) . This particular section of the movie is considered 1 of the top 3 scenes in Tamil movies, if not # 1, across last 100 years of Cinema in the South.
