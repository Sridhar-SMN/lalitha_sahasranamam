# Nama 12/1000 : Apr 20

निजारुण-प्रभापूर-मज्जद्ब्रह्माण्ड-मण्डला : nijāruṇa-prabhāpūra-majjadbrahmāṇḍa-maṇḍalā

Her red-rose like complexion radiates the universe with red colour. From this nāma onwards, the gross description of Lalitāmbikā begins. When physical description of a God is made, it is from foot to head and for Goddesses it is from head to foot. For Lalitāmbikā, the description begins from Her head. 

For the next 60 odd namas  it will be very specific describing the form of the Divine mother, her throne, her army, city etc . We will cover 2 namas per day as the comments will be very brief. Only nama 44 and couple more in 60’s we will expand as there are significant points to make. 

You can pick any one of the next 60 odd namas and use it for objectification/focus during you Dhyana/meditation etc 

So next month or so will be easy ride for me.

Footnote 

Even for this nama we can give an advanced interpretation by taking Nija as “own” and Aruna as “light” and equating it to substratum/adhistanam etc especially given that both in the Upanishads and Gita, light is used as proxy for Brahman/Atman . But it is better left as a Saguna description. However do note though that all Saguna descriptions have a a deeper Nirguna interpretation, just like every Puranic story has an underlying Vedantic purpose driving us unsuspectingly but surely towards our finding our real identity. 

I truly believe it is all one giant satvic scam by the Lord/Divine Mother in cahoots with our Rishis neatly disguising and packaging the same stuff to suit our different individual temperaments. 

For some of us Saguna Ishwara Bakthi angle works best, for a few others Puranic stories work nicely and for some “weird” few Vedanta , especially Advaita, works straight away. Divine Mother, as Srimata to all, has to only decide which text book+tuition master (guru) combo She needs to send our way. 😀🙏
