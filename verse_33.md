Bhandasura with his army was burned up by the fire of (the weapon of) Kämesvara. Kama + Easwara = He who has conquered desires or Maya itself. Lord Krishna explains this in the 3rd chapter of the Gita with the phrase नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं = nānavāptam (nothing to be attained)  avāptavyaṁ (nothing to be gained). As we saw in name 65 (May 31), Bhandasura represents the potent mix of desires, attachment, anger and consequently our inability to see our own real nature which we saw was the real meaning of the word Asura. 

In Naishkarmaya Siddhi (a beautiful text by Sureshwaracharya) he lists 7 steps why this happens to us making us forget our real nature as Atman and are stuck in this samsara

how Ajnanam is the cause of Samsara 

1. because of ignornace of the one reality  
2. there is a faulty dviaita darshanam where we see things/people/world as "other" than us
3. when i perceive duality i see things as favourable and unfavourable
4. leads to raga and dvesha (likes and dislikes)
5. raga & dvesha consequently lead to dharma/adharma action- we do actions which get us what we want and do actions which keep us what we dislike
6. dharma/adharma actions lead to punya/papam
7. punya/papam leads to deha prapthi (superior and inferior physical bodies) & deha prapthi leads to samsara 

The Brahmanda Purana (in which appears LS) says, " The supreme Mother, Lalita blazing with anger, and throwing the whole universe into confusion, suddenly rendered lifeless, with the great weapon of Kamesa shining like the sun, the mighty Asura, the fierce and wicked Bhauda who was left alone, all his relations being slain. By flames discharged from that weapon his city called Sûnyaka (emptiness) with the women, children, cattle, and wealth, was suddenly burnt up and its site alone remained: thus the city became empty and its name (Sünyaka)". This nama is genuinely confusing as it seems to allude to the Buddhist Soonyavada arguement which argues there is nothing called Consciousness or God but the key difference being Lalithambike remains hence it is safe to conclude there is no room for Buddhists to celebrate the use of word Soonya (zero) in this nama. When that state of Sarnsara (Jivabhäva) which appears to the devotee as void, is removed, himself remains, as consciousness alone.

Like we saw in the nama yesterday when reading BG 10.11 - नाशयाम्यात्मभावस्थो ज्ञानदीपेन भास्वता = nāśhayāmyātma-bhāva-stho jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā = destroy the darkness born of ignorance, with the luminous lamp of knowledge. The lamp of the Gita here in LS is the Fire of Kameswara.

There is another definition for Kāmeśvara. He is liked by all and all like Him. Thus He becomes both subject as well as object. Object is Śiva and liking is the subject. Generally, Śiva is always referred as the subject. Vāk Devis end this part of Sahasranāma with a subtle hint on renunciation. Renunciation is one of the steps to realise the Nirguṇa Brahman. All renunciations are in favour of the Supreme Self (nirguṇa Brahman). This is confirmed in Bṛihadāraṇayaka Upaniṣad (II.4.5) which says, “The Self should be realised, should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By realisation of the Self, all is known.” There is nothing beyond that. Kāmeśvara is the Supreme Self or the Brahman. Bhandāsura refers to ego. Army refers to the subtle body (mind). When ego and activities of subtle body are removed, what remains is only the Brahman. Since Bhandāsura has been destroyed along with his army, what remains is the śūnya or void. This means the thought of duality has gone paving way for realization of the Brahman. The destination can be achieved by meditation and internal exploration. This also ties in neatly with the analysis of Sureshwaracharya in Naishkarmya Siddhi.
