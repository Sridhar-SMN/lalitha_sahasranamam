# nama  7 / 1000 -  Apr 13 

7. चतुर्बाहु-समन्विता  - caturbāhu-samanvitā

The physical appearance of Lalithambike begins here. This nama simply means - She has four arms . These four arms represent Her ministers, through whom She administers.  These ministers are described in the subsequent four namas. You will notice as we go forward that in the four hands  (chatur bhuj avatar - four hands avatar) and just like in the Gita, the Divine mother is holding something or the other in every hand, each of which represents something spiritually and practically significant. A question that may come to our mind is where is the blessed hand that is supposed to show us the "Abhaya" sign ?  She is not like typical image we see of a deity showing one palm and kind of saying -  "dont worry, i am there & have got your back".   It is here that the brilliance of our Rishis shines through and there is a subsequent nama in LS and a related story on the idol of the Goddess in the Lalithambike temple at Thirumeychur that will reveal a very subtle yet beautiful point.

## Advance preparation for next 2 Namas

Probably the 2 most important namas in our spiritual journey are coming up in 8 and 9. Pretty much every scripture has this and it is borrowed from the Mahanarayana Upanishad. 

Lord Krishna borrows this concept heavily into the Gita and quotes this as  the “2 enemies of life” to be overcome. We will see how with Lalithambike’s blessing we conquer them. 

The Kamokarsheet Japam  (jaap) orginally from the Mahanarayana Upanishad and in this mantra Kamoekarsheet Manyurakarsheet Namo namaha both Desire (Kama) and Anger (Manyu) are raised to a special  status and salutations is given to them. Even gods are bound to  these qualities.

‘Kamokarsheet’ in Sanskrit means ‘those acts that are out of desire’.‘Manyurakarsheet’   means “those acts that are committed out of anger”.

A wise Jnani (when he was a little boy) was always doing a particular japam and here goes the story : 

Many great scholars at Kanchipuram were always surprised to see the small boy sitting in the corner of the temple and murmuring something. Once, they all decided to question the boy and get an idea about what he is doing all these days. They all went and called to him.

"Oh Boy ! What are you doing" - they asked. An immediate reply came: 

" I need to get rid of my Karma ; So I am doing Japam for that"

The scholars never expected such a mature reply from a small boy. 

"What are you chanting for this purpose?"

The little boy again gave an astounding reply  : 

"Kamokarsheet namo namah: Kamokarsheet
kamah karoti naaham karomi
kamah karta naham karta
kamah kaarayitaa naham kaarayita;
Esha the kaama kaamaaya swaha:

Manyurakaarsheet namo namah: Manyuh akaarsheet
manyuh karoti naham karomi
manyuh karta naham karta
manyuh kaarayita naham kaarayita;
Esha the manyo manyave swaha:"

I have  completed half my target, and I am yet to complete the remaining to get rid of my Karma, he said. He then explained the significance of the statement and also its actual meaning.

"Desire performed the act. Desire did the act. Desire is doing the act, not I (Self). Desire is the agent not I. Desire causes the doer to act not I. O Desire, fascinating in form, let this oblation be offered to thee, Hail!

Anger performed the act. Anger did the act. Anger is doing the act; not I. Anger is the agent; not I. Anger causes the doer to act; not I. O Anger, let this oblation be offered to thee. Hail! " 

The small boy suggested to the veteran scholars 

"Dear Sirs, even you people start chanting this; Only this can kill karma. - And without getting rid of Desire and Anger; which cause Kartritva (doership) & hence Karma, how can you qualify for Moksha (salvation) ?" 

The scriptures call this the shift to the Nivrithi marga from the Pravriti marga  - this also forms the central theme of young Nachiketha’s challenge to his father and his subsequent interaction with Lord Yama in Katho Upanishad. Lord Yama is so impressed that he renames the highest form of yagya in the Vedas as  ‘Nachiketha Yagya’ . Lord Krishna in the Gita borrows heavily from Katho Upanishad and in many places directly does a cut/paste of the Upanishad’s mantras into the Gita. 

In Rudram where Lord Shiva is hailed as Lord Manyu (the Lord of Anger)  the concluding prayer is the famous Maha-Mrityunjaya Mantra 

त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् ।
उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनात् मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् || 

Try-Ambakam Yajaamahe 
Sugandhim Pusstti-Vardhanam
Urvaarukam-Iva Bandhanaan 
Mrtyor-Mukssiiya Maa-[A]mrtaat ||

This normally gets translated as : 

1: We Worship the Tryambaka (the Three-Eyed One), 
2: Who is Fragrant (as the Spiritual Essence), Increasing the Nourishment (of our Spiritual Core);
3: From these many Bondages (of Samsara) similar to Cucumbers (tied to their Creepers),
4: May I be Liberated from Death (Attachment to Perishable Things), So that I am not separated from the perception of Immortality (Immortal Essence pervading everywhere). 

But Swami P says this is a very weak and amateur way to interpret the last line. We are praying to none other than Lord Shiva so it has to be much more grand(er) than that - it is not free me from bondage but make these bondages move away from me (it is said in this breed of cucumber quoted in this sloka, it is the creeper that moves away from the ripened cucumber and not that the cucumber drops off when ripened. When I first heard this explanation I was in awe of our Rishis who came up with these mantras and their keen sense of observation) 

Prayer to Lalithambike with the chant of LS is believed to have the same effect of divine blessing (a) a beginner seeker gets to be more qualified  and (b) the qualified seeker takes that giant step inwards
