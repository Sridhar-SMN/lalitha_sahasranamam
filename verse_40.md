## 107. तडिल्लता-समरुचिः - Tatillatha samaruchi - Aug 23

She shines like a bolt of lightning. A description borrowed straight from the Keno Upanishad where the higher nature of the Divine Mother as Brahman/Atman is compareed to lightning.  The suggestion here is not that Brahman Jnanam comes in a flash or is miraculous spark but more to emphasise the power and its ability to light up the dark clouds in an instant. 

The Keno Upanishad reference of this nama https://shlokam.org/texts/kena-4-4/ but an even more beautiful reference to Brahman as Lightning and as an object of meditation/nidhidyasanam is found in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad

Verse 5.7.1:

विद्युद् ब्रह्मेत्याहुः; विदानाद्विद्युत्; विद्यत्येनं पाप्मनो य एवं वेद विद्युद्ब्रह्मेति; विद्युद्ध्येव ब्रह्म ||
vidyud brahmetyāhuḥ; vidānādvidyut; vidyatyenaṃ pāpmano ya evaṃ veda vidyudbrahmeti; vidyuddhyeva brahma || 

Meaning : They say lightning is Brahman. It is called lightning (Vidyut) because it scatters (darkness). He who knows it as such—that lightning is Brahman—scatters evils (that are ranged against) him, for lightning is indeed Brahman. Another meditation on the same Satya-Brahman, with particular result, is being introduced. They say lightning is Brahman. The derivation of lightning as Brahman is being given: It is called lightning (Vidyut) because it scatters darkness. Really lightning flashes cleaving the darkness due to clouds. He who knows it as such, knows that lightning is Brahman as possessed of the above attributes, scatters or dispels all the evils that are ranged against him. It is a fitting result for one who knows it as such—that lightning is Brahman, for lightning is indeed Brahman.

#### So the next time you see lightning in the sky pls remember this nama and its significance

She is residing above the six chakras.  I am tempted to write a longish note but given the Nirguna Svarupam is going to be dealt in next few verses will spare you the torture. 

## 109. महासक्तिः - Mahasakti - Aug 24 

The nama is to be split as Maha + Asaktih = Contemplation + Liking. Maha normally means great or superlative but here it used to mean 'prayer/meditation/contemplation' (it also is at times used to denote festivals)  and asaktiḥ means liking.  In a subsequent nama it will be shown that the divine mother is attained thru internal contemplation (antharmukha samaradhya) and we will cover the details when we reach that nama because to explain the broader concept of Divine mother as our atma svarupam we need to lay a bit more foundation.

## 110. कुण्डलिनी - kundalini - Aug 25

I was hoping Adi Shankaracharya will give us an easy way out as this is nama 907 in Vishnu Sahasranamam but he has given a very cryptic note on Kundali which does not explain much.  So here starts my somewhat not so brief explanation. 

The popular definition of Kundalini is the the serpent which is coiled in the Muladhara chakra  and it is broadly in reference to Maya (more on that later) and Sage Vāsiṣṭha says to Lord Rāma in Yoga Vashista - “Like the coiled body of a serpent when it sleeps, like a plantain flower it is exceedingly delicate within, hissing like an angry female serpent, causing fluctuations in the mind = how the vasanas of the svabhava manifest. This becomes purified only by the rays of jñāna or knowledge. Thus this Saktī rejoices in the name of puryaṣṭaka." 

Now we have seen this word "puryastaka" before in nama 77-78 (June 14th)  when we saw the birth of Lord Ganesha. Without repeating it will summarise it by saying the entirity of Maya is referred to as Kundalini. Now what is "Maya" is probably the most complex topic and I hope to have the courage one day to take you thru Adi Shankaracharya's description of this from Viveka Chudamani but for now we will simply state it as the "veil of ignorance" which prevents us (the Atman) from seeing our real nature and projects this body/mind/world as Real - the avarana (covering) & vikshepa (projecting) power of Maya.  The story we quoted yesterday of the Sage who renounced wealth for Jnanam is worthwhile remembering here. He had thru adequate discrimination and vairagyam overcome the trappings of Kundalini/Maya and obtained Jnanam to break thru the shackles of Maya/Avidya.

Again borrowing from the footnote to nama 66 from June 1 this remark by Ramana Maharshi explains this concept well 

If you see something as separate from you then it is the wrong cognition or wrong perception. He says if everything that you see or you know directly to be your own Self and is not separate from you in the sense that there is no “I” inside you perceiving something out there, he says then that is the correct understanding the correct experience of the world. He is not saying that it is not there but what he is saying is you have got a superimposition of a wrong idea. What you are seeing is an external thing which you take to be real but it essentially is the Self/Reality in which appears you and the world and so long as you imagine you are in that body looking at the world, you are going to suffer.  But he says once you get rid of the person inside who is looking outside at something then you find your own natural state (Sampatkari of LS). 

The incorrect imagination is the consequence of Kundalini/Maya. Lord Krishna captures it so beautifully in one phrase  in the Bhagavad Gita in sloka 13.02  - इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय - Idham sariram Kaunteya and again in Gita sloka 7.13.  We wont expand on it here and will reserve it when we look at Maya/Avidya.

Wishing all a blessed weekend.


--------------
I know we have some seriously advanced students in this group who will feel I have let them down when explaining Kundalini.  So to make sure they also get a headache, I cut/paste a Q&A with Swami P on Maya/Avidya.   And for the rest of you normal humans pls delete this message as soon as you see it. 

Question : What is the nature of moolavidya?

Answer: Moolavidya or maya (or Kundalini as above nama) is the manifestor of the entire universe . The entire world of anatma is a product of this alone. It wields its power of avarana by which it conceals the truth about Brahman and makes the jiva to believe that the world is real through its vikshepa-sakti. The real problem is not vikshepa-sakti but avarana-sakti. It is the avarana-sakti which creates Atma-ajnanam for the individual. It is the cause of mithya-jnanam which makes the individual to believe that anatma really exists and is experienced. This mithya-jnanam alone leads to prapancha-darsanam and the consequent samsara. Shankaracharya calls even karma as ajnanam as it binds the karta. Note that maya cannot really cover the reality, Brahman, like a cloud can never cover the sun. It only covers our knowing ability to know Brahman and thus acts as an obstruction to Brahman-Knowledge. As long as this ignorance lasts, the world will appear to be real to us and we will be feeling the samsaritva all the time. It is through vedantic study and Mahavakya-vichara that one can transcend moolavidya.

In all the three states of existence (waking, dream & deep sleep), this ignorance is located in the consciousness in the mind. When one says ‘I am ignorant’ it means the Atma ‘I’ in him is the locus of his ignorance. Anatma mind itself cannot be its locus since it itself is a product of ignorance. Jagrat prapancha is created by moolavidya located in Me, the Sakshi. In other words, ‘I’ am the creator of jagrat prapancha and swapna prapancha through moolavidya. Neither of them have an existence of their own, as both are mithya.When the seeker gets ‘aham Brahmasmi’ wisdom, this ignorance gets automatically wiped out. Even though Atma and the mind with ignorance are very close to each other, Atma being actionless cannot remove the ignorance. It has to be removed only through Sastra- vichara and obtaining Brahma-jnanam.
