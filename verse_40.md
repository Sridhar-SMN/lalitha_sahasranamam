## 107. तडिल्लता-समरुचिः - Tatillatha samaruchi - Aug 23

She shines like a bolt of lightning. A description borrowed straight from the Keno Upanishad where the higher nature of the Divine Mother as Brahman/Atman is compareed to lightning.  The suggestion here is not that Brahman Jnanam comes in a flash or is miraculous spark but more to emphasise the power and its ability to light up the dark clouds in an instant. 

The Keno Upanishad reference of this nama https://shlokam.org/texts/kena-4-4/ but an even more beautiful reference to Brahman as Lightning and as an object of meditation/nidhidyasanam is found in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad

Verse 5.7.1:

विद्युद् ब्रह्मेत्याहुः; विदानाद्विद्युत्; विद्यत्येनं पाप्मनो य एवं वेद विद्युद्ब्रह्मेति; विद्युद्ध्येव ब्रह्म ||
vidyud brahmetyāhuḥ; vidānādvidyut; vidyatyenaṃ pāpmano ya evaṃ veda vidyudbrahmeti; vidyuddhyeva brahma || 

Meaning : They say lightning is Brahman. It is called lightning (Vidyut) because it scatters (darkness). He who knows it as such—that lightning is Brahman—scatters evils (that are ranged against) him, for lightning is indeed Brahman. Another meditation on the same Satya-Brahman, with particular result, is being introduced. They say lightning is Brahman. The derivation of lightning as Brahman is being given: It is called lightning (Vidyut) because it scatters darkness. Really lightning flashes cleaving the darkness due to clouds. He who knows it as such, knows that lightning is Brahman as possessed of the above attributes, scatters or dispels all the evils that are ranged against him. It is a fitting result for one who knows it as such—that lightning is Brahman, for lightning is indeed Brahman.

So the next time you see lightning in the sky pls remember this nama and its significance
