निर्लेपा निर्मला नित्या निराकारा निराकुला । 
निर्गुणा निष्कला शान्ता निष्कामा निरुपप्लवा ॥ 

Nirlepa nirmala nitya nirakara nirakula |
Nirguna nishkala shanta nishkama nirupaplava ||


## Nama 134 - निर्लेपा - Nirlepa - Sep 27

Lepa means stain or attachment & Nirlepa means without stain or attachment.  As Nirguna Brahman the Divine mother is not impacted by the events of the Universe.  As we saw earlier even the Divine Mother is at absolute peace only by claiming her higher nature.  Should she ever make the mistake of identifying with her Avatara alone, She will become a maha-samsari. 

Lord Krishna brings this our in several slokas of the Gita but specifically would like to highlight 2 - and the key statement is where the Lord says anyone else who understands this concept well is also liberated as they are not bound by the actions and free from the consequences.

#### न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा | इति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते || - 4.14 

4.14 Because of the absence of egoism, those karmani, actions; na limpanti, do not taint; mam, Me, by becoming the originators of body etc. And me, for Me; na sprha, there is no hankering for the results of those actions. But in the case of transmigrating beings, who have self-identification in the form, 'I am the agent', and thirst for actions as also for their results, it is reasonable that actions should taint them. Owing to the absence of these, actions do not taint Me. Anyone else, too, yah, who; abhijanati, knows; mam, Me; iti, thus, as his own Self, and (knows), 'I am not an agent; I have no hankering for the results of actions'; sah, he; na badhyate, does not become bound; karmabhih, by actions. In his case also actions cease to be the originators of body etc. This is the import.

#### अनादित्वान्निर्गुणत्वात्परमात्मायमव्यय: | शरीरस्थोऽपि कौन्तेय न करोति न लिप्यते || - 13.32 (701 count) - the focus is on the second line but I attaching the full explanation by Adi Shanakracharya

13.32 Anadivat, being without beginning: Adih means cause; that which has no cause is anadih. That which has a cause undergoes loss of its own characteristics. But this One, being causeless, has no parts. This being so, It does not suffer loss. So also, nirgunatvat, being without alities (we will see in another nama in this LS sloka)  indeed, It is only something possessing alities that perishes owing to the losss of its alities. But this One, being without alities, does not perish. Hence, ayam, this; paramatma, supreme Self; is avyayah, immutable. It suffers no depletion.  

#### Therefore It is immutable. Since this is so, therefore, api, although; sarira-sthah, existing in the body-since the perception of the Self occurs in the bodies, It is said to be 'existing in the body'; even then, It na, does not; karoti, act. From the very fact that It does not act, It na, is not; lipyate, affected by the result of any action. For, one who is an agent of action becomes affected by its result. But this One is not an agent. Hence It is not affected by any result. This is the meaning of Nirlepa. 

## Nama 135 - निर्मला - Nirmala - Sep 28

Mala (Malam or dirt and not Mala as in garland) is known as innate ignorance that conceals the true nature of the Self. As the Divine mother controls "maya" she is not impacted by the traps of ignornace and therefore Nirmala. 

We can write pages on each of these namas but some of this will become repetitive. Like you would see we can borrow a lot of the concepts from Nama 134 to explain 135 without repeating the points.  I am highlighting the meaning of the word where important.


## Nama 136 - नित्या- Nitya - Sep 29

Nitya means eternal and without changes. As nirguṇa Brahman is being discussed, one of the qualities of the Brahman is explained here. Bṛhadaraṇyaka Upaniṣad  describes the Brahman as “the Self is indeed immutable and indestructible”. Brahman is beyond changes and exists everywhere, omnipresent.

Lord Krishna brings this out in many slokas between 2.11-2.29 of the Gita and three  of the most beautiful slokas to describe the concept of eternal = Nitya are 2.24 (which actually has the word Nitya) and 10.20 & finally the most important sloka of the Gita 2.16

अच्छेद्योऽयमदाह्योऽयमक्लेद्योऽशोष्य एव च | नित्य: सर्वगत: स्थाणुरचलोऽयं सनातन: || 

2.24 Since this is so, therefore ayam, It; acchedyah, cannot be cut. Since the other elements which are the causes of destruction of one ano ther are not capable of destroying this Self, therefore It is nityah, eternal. Being eternal, It is sarva-gatah, omnipresent. Being omnipresent, It is sthanuh, stationary, i.e. fixed like a stump. Being fixed, ayam, this Self; is acalah, unmoving. Therefore It is sanatanah, changeless, i.e. It is not produced from any cause, as a new thing. It is not to be argued that 'these verses are repetive since eternality and changelessness of the Self have been stated in a single verse itself, "Never is this One born, and never does It die," etc. (20). Whatever has been said there (in verse 19) about the Self does not go beyond the meaning of this verse. Something is repeated with those very words, and something ideologically.' Since the object, viz the Self, is inscrutable, therefore Lord Vasudeva raises the topic again and again, and explains that very object in other words so that, somehow, the unmanifest Self may come within the comprehension of the intellect of the transmigrating persons and bring about a cessation of their cycles of births and deaths.

and I am linking this to sloka 10.20 (which happens to be Ramana Maharishi's favorite sloka of the Gita) where as Nirguna Brahman the Lord says He is the beginning, middle and end of all beings.  

अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थित: | अहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च || 

10.20 Gudakesa, O Gudakesa-gudaka means sleep, and isa means master; master of that (sleep) is gudakesa, i.e. one who has conquered sleep of ignorance;  aham, I; am the atma, Self, the indwelling Self; who is to be ever-meditated on as sarva-bhuta-asaya-sthitah, residing in the hearts of all beings. And, by one who is unable to do so, I am to be meditated on through the following aspects. I am capable of being meditated on (through them) becasue aham, I; am verily the adih, beginning, the origin; and the madhyam, middle, continuance; ca, as also; the antah, end, dissolution; bhutanam, of (all) beings. 'I am to be meditated upon thus also:'


नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सत: | उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभि: || 


2.16 न not? असतः of the unreal? विद्यते is? भावः being? न not? अभावः nonbeing? विद्यते is? सतः of the real? उभयोः of the two? अपि also? दृष्टः (has been) seen? अन्तः the final truth? तु indeed? अनयोः of these? तत्त्वदर्शिभिः by the knowers of the Truth.Commentary -- The changeless? homogeneous Atman or the Self always exists. It is the only solid Reality. This phenomenal world of names and forms is ever changing. Hence it is unreal. The sage or the Jivanmukta is fully aware that the Self always exists and that this world is like a mirage. Through his Jnanachakshus or the eye of intuition? he directly cognises the Self. This world vanishes for him like the snake in the rope? after it has been seen that only the rope exists. He rejects the names and forms and takes the underlying Essence in all the names and forms? viz.? AstiBhatiPriya or Satchidananda or ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute. Hence he is a Tattvadarshi or a knower of the Truth or the Essence.What is changing must be unreal. What is constant or permanent must be real.

According to Swami P the whole teaching of the Gita is already over in sloka 2.11 where the concept of Nitya is explained by Krishna stating the wise do not grieve for the ephemeral.  Swami P then  says it is for the dull heads that Lord Krishna had to do another 650 odd slokas. 

## Nama 137 - निराकारा - Nirakara - Oct 2 

She is formless. Akara means form, figure, shape etc. - essentially available for sense perception. Normally avyaktam gets translated as unmanifest but what it really means is not available for sense perception.

A simple summary of how the Upanishads and Gurus teach the concept of the Nirguna & formless Brahman 

Q : Brahman itself is avyaktham and indriya agocharam and also cannot be explained in words (jaathi, guna, kriya, sambandha  roodi vilakshanam) . So how is it revealed ? 

A: Thank god there is this Mithya world and with this Mithya world the scriptures create a Mithya sambandha and a Mithya guru explains this Mithya jnanam to remove the Mithya avidya in the Mithya mind.  It is therefore extremely important to understand the true meaning of "mithya" - that which does not have an independent reality is "Mithya" or to put it more technically - that which appears in the locus of its absence is called Mithya. 

Swami P captures the 5 principles of existence and consciousness in a beautiful capsule - they read pretty much the same but worth repeating here 

### Five Features of Consciousness (equally applicable for Existence)

1) Consciousness is not part, product or property of the body
2) Consciousness is an independent entity or principle which pervades and enlivens the body
3) Consciousness is not limited by the boundaries of the body
4) Consciousness continues to exist or survive even after the death of the body
#### 5) The surviving consciousness is not accessible because of the absence of the body medium

Combining these 2 Swami P summarises this into the key teachings of Vedanta

### Five principles of Vedanta 

1)    I am of the nature of eternal and all-pervading Consciousness.
2)    I am the only source of permanent, peace, security and happiness
3)    By my mere presence, I give life to the material body and through the body, I experience the material universe. The word “body” includes the mind because the mind is also a subtle form of body
4)    I am not affected by anything that takes place in the material world and in the material body, including the material mind
5)    By forgetting my nature, I convert life into a struggle and by remembering my nature, I convert life into a sport or entertainment.
