निर्लेपा निर्मला नित्या निराकारा निराकुला । 
निर्गुणा निष्कला शान्ता निष्कामा निरुपप्लवा ॥ 

Nirlepa nirmala nitya nirakara nirakula |
Nirguna nishkala shanta nishkama nirupaplava ||


## Nama 134 - निर्लेपा - Nirlepa - Sep 27

Lepa means stain or attachment & Nirlepa means without stain or attachment.  As Nirguna Brahman the Divine mother is not impacted by the events of the Universe.  As we saw earlier even the Divine Mother is at absolute peace only by claiming her higher nature.  Should she ever make the mistake of identifying with her Avatara alone, She will become a maha-samsari. 

Lord Krishna brings this our in several slokas of the Gita but specifically would like to highlight 2 - and the key statement is where the Lord says anyone else who understands this concept well is also liberated as they are not bound by the actions and free from the consequences.

#### न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा | इति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते || - 4.14 

4.14 Because of the absence of egoism, those karmani, actions; na limpanti, do not taint; mam, Me, by becoming the originators of body etc. And me, for Me; na sprha, there is no hankering for the results of those actions. But in the case of transmigrating beings, who have self-identification in the form, 'I am the agent', and thirst for actions as also for their results, it is reasonable that actions should taint them. Owing to the absence of these, actions do not taint Me. Anyone else, too, yah, who; abhijanati, knows; mam, Me; iti, thus, as his own Self, and (knows), 'I am not an agent; I have no hankering for the results of actions'; sah, he; na badhyate, does not become bound; karmabhih, by actions. In his case also actions cease to be the originators of body etc. This is the import.

#### अनादित्वान्निर्गुणत्वात्परमात्मायमव्यय: | शरीरस्थोऽपि कौन्तेय न करोति न लिप्यते || - 13.32 (701 count) - the focus is on the second line but I attaching the full explanation by Adi Shanakracharya

13.32 Anadivat, being without beginning: Adih means cause; that which has no cause is anadih. That which has a cause undergoes loss of its own characteristics. But this One, being causeless, has no parts. This being so, It does not suffer loss. So also, nirgunatvat, being without alities (we will see in another nama in this LS sloka)  indeed, It is only something possessing alities that perishes owing to the losss of its alities. But this One, being without alities, does not perish. Hence, ayam, this; paramatma, supreme Self; is avyayah, immutable. It suffers no depletion.  

#### Therefore It is immutable. Since this is so, therefore, api, although; sarira-sthah, existing in the body-since the perception of the Self occurs in the bodies, It is said to be 'existing in the body'; even then, It na, does not; karoti, act. From the very fact that It does not act, It na, is not; lipyate, affected by the result of any action. For, one who is an agent of action becomes affected by its result. But this One is not an agent. Hence It is not affected by any result. This is the meaning of Nirlepa. 

## Nama 135 - निर्मला - Nirmala - Sep 28

Mala (Malam or dirt and not Mala as in garland) is known as innate ignorance that conceals the true nature of the Self. As the Divine mother controls "maya" she is not impacted by the traps of ignornace and therefore Nirmala. 

We can write pages on each of these namas but some of this will become repetitive. Like you would see we can borrow a lot of the concepts from Nama 134 to explain 135 without repeating the points.  I am highlighting the meaning of the word where important.
