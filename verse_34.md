Seemingly simple but a very very powerful nama. Unfortunately all the Tamil and Hindi mythology movies depicting this nama have messed us up. Let us try to uncover the false propaganda and pls be ready for a slightly heavy reading. 

The story embedded here is the burnt manmatha (god of love) was resurrected by the Divine mother using the drug (aushadhi) Sanjivani . Yes, the same herb that Hanumanji got for Lakshmana in Ramayana - looks like the ancient days equivalent of Dolo 650.

Of course the story is for LKG students and you can be rest assured that we steadfast Advaitins will be able to twist anything and everything to Brahman and Maya. Manmatha represents desires and the third eye of Shiva (हर-नेत्राग्नि =  hara-netrāgni) represents knowledge (by the way the 3rd eye is not a physical eye like we see in movies but the eye of wisdom - jnana chakshu). The real meaning is  liberation means knowing the inner self which is possible only by eradication of ignorance or avidyā. We think we have knowledge of Brahman but lack experience of Brahman but strangely this is one Jnanam where we “experience” Brahman in everything but lack the knowledge to filter out the name and form. In any other material science or social science experience follows knowledge but in Atma Jnanam experience precedes knowledge. When ignorance (of name and form)  is removed, what remains is knowledge or vidyā. That is why the worship of Lalithambike is called Śrī Vidyā. Burning of Manmatha is the removal of avidyā and his resurrection is para vidyā - the ultimate knowledge. Manmatha before his killing was an embodiment of avidyā that mainly comprises of ego and resurrected Manmatha was with pure knowledge. His ego was burnt by Śiva and knowledge was given to him by Śaktī.

Another possible interesting interpretation is by taking the ‘Panchakritya’ or Five Duties of Lord Shiva as per Shiva Purana and focusing on the final two. The five are ‘Srishti’ (Creation) represented by Lord Brahma, ‘Sthithi’ (Preservation) represented by Lord Vishnu and ‘Laya’ (Destruction) represented by Lord Rudra,‘ Tirobhav’  (Concealment and Revival) represented by Lord Maheshwara and ‘Anugraha’ (Providing Salvation/right knowledge) represented by Lord Sadashiva as the Guru. Taking the Tirobhava and Anugraha aspects we can see the logic in this nama - Lord Shiva as the remover of ignorance of Manmatha and Divine Mother as the Guru in giving the right knowledge to Manmatha who now devoid of Ahamkara has the fully blossemed Brahman Aakara Vritti and Jnanam of his true identity. Incidentally the origin of the word GURU = GU+RU (remover of ignorance and provider of light=knowledge of the Atman) is also using this very paradigm of Maheswara and Sadashiva. The manifested form of Sadashiva is Lord Dakshinamurthy even though I beliebe He is also depicted in another form. Hopefully one of these days we get to weave in the brilliant explanation of Swami P on Dakshinamurthy Stotram-DS (which i truly believe is his masterpiece and Swamiji himself calls the stotram the Phd of all scriptures) into our LS explanations. Divine mother is revealed as Lord Dakshinamurthy (there is a beautiful back story for that) in verse 140 but I am hoping divine grace allows us to blend in the learnings from DS much earlier.

Next post on Asia Monday. Be ready to be fascinated when we prove the Pancadasi mantra and its structure is entirely followed in the Gayatri Mantra. You will be able to see how the Gayatri Mantra, which is the highest non-dual truth, can also be visualised in the form of the Divine mother. Worthwhile to read the note i sent earlier this week on Gayatri Mantra in prepration for next week.

Wishing all a blessed weekend !

Pañcadaśī (Panchadasi) mantra consists of three groups consisting of bīja-s and each line is called kūṭa or group. The three kūṭa-s are known as vāgbhava kūṭa,  madhya kūṭa and śakti kūtā. Vāgbhava kūṭa represents Lalitāmbikā’s face, madya kūṭa represents the portion between Her neck and hip and the last one śakti kūṭa represents the portion below Her hip. The whole form of Lalitāmbikā is made up of these three kūṭa-s. This is one of the reasons why Pañcadaśī (Panchadasi) is considered as very powerful. These three kūṭa-s are joined in such a way that an inverted triangle is formed which represents Her yoni, the source of the universe. This is why this mantra is considered as highly secretive. Vāgbhava kūṭa is the right side of this triangle, kāmarāja kūṭa the upper side and śakti kūṭa forms the left side of the triangle.

Vāgbhava kūṭa consists of five bīja-s viz. ka-e-ī-la-hrīṁ ; Madhya kūṭa consists of six bīja-s viz. ha-sa-ka-ha-la-hrīṁ & Sakti kūṭa consists of four bīja-s viz. sa-ka-la-hrīṁ. Thus, we have fifteen bījas of Pañcadaśī (Panchadasi). This mantra is not revealed by these bīja-s, but by the following verse from Tripuropanishad :

कामो योनि: कमला वज्रपाणिर्गुहाहसा मतरिश्वाभ्रामिन्द्रः। पुनर्गुहासकल मायया च पुरुच्येषा विश्वमातादिविद्या॥
kāmo yoni: kamalā vajrapāṇirguhāhasā matariśvābhrāmindraḥ| punarguhāsakala māyayā ca purucyeṣā viśvamātādividyā||

If you remember I resumed post our summer break with the explanation of Gayatri Mantra by Swami P.  It was basically in preparation for the next 3-4 namas 

तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं।  tat saviturvareṇyaṁ = Vagbhava Kuta 
भर्गो देवस्य धीमही। bhargo devasya dhīmahī = Madhya Kuta
धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्॥ dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt = Sakti Kuta 

So there you go - the connection between the Gayatri Mantra and Pancadasi Mantra.
