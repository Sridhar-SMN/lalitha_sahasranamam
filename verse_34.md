The story embedded here is the burnt manmatha (god of love) was resurrected by the Divine mother using Sanjivani (yes, the same herb that Hanumanji got for Lakshmana in Ramayana - looks like the ancient days equivalent of Dolo 650)

Of course the story is for LKG students and you can guess we Advaitins will be able to twist anything and everything to Brahman and Maya. Manmatha represents desires and the third eye of Shiva represents knowledge (by the way the 3rd eye is not a physical eye like we see in movies). The real meaning is that liberation means knowing the inner self which is possible only by eradication of ignorance or avidyā. When ignorance is removed, what remains is knowledge or vidyā. That is why the worship of Lalithambike is called Śrī Vidyā. Burning of Manmatha is the removal of avidyā and his resurrection is para vidyā - the ultimate knowledge. Manmatha before his killing was an embodiment of avidyā that mainly comprises of ego and resurrected Manmatha was with pure knowledge. His ego was burnt by Śiva and knowledge was given to him by Śaktī.

Pañcadaśī (Panchadasi) mantra consists of three groups consisting of bīja-s and each line is called kūṭa or group. The three kūṭa-s are known as vāgbhava kūṭa,  madhya kūṭa and śakti kūtā. Vāgbhava kūṭa represents Lalitāmbikā’s face, madya kūṭa represents the portion between Her neck and hip and the last one śakti kūṭa represents the portion below Her hip. The whole form of Lalitāmbikā is made up of these three kūṭa-s. This is one of the reasons why Pañcadaśī (Panchadasi) is considered as very powerful. These three kūṭa-s are joined in such a way that an inverted triangle is formed which represents Her yoni, the source of the universe. This is why this mantra is considered as highly secretive. Vāgbhava kūṭa is the right side of this triangle, kāmarāja kūṭa the upper side and śakti kūṭa forms the left side of the triangle.

Vāgbhava kūṭa consists of five bīja-s viz. ka-e-ī-la-hrīṁ ; Madhya kūṭa consists of six bīja-s viz. ha-sa-ka-ha-la-hrīṁ & Sakti kūṭa consists of four bīja-s viz. sa-ka-la-hrīṁ. Thus, we have fifteen bījas of Pañcadaśī (Panchadasi). This mantra is not revealed by these bīja-s, but by the following verse from Tripuropanishad :

कामो योनि: कमला वज्रपाणिर्गुहाहसा मतरिश्वाभ्रामिन्द्रः। पुनर्गुहासकल मायया च पुरुच्येषा विश्वमातादिविद्या॥
kāmo yoni: kamalā vajrapāṇirguhāhasā matariśvābhrāmindraḥ| punarguhāsakala māyayā ca purucyeṣā viśvamātādividyā||

If you remember I resumed post our summer break with the explanation of Gayatri Mantra by Swami P.  It was basically in preparation for the next 3-4 namas 

तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं। om tat saviturvareṇyaṁ | = Vagbhava Kuta 
भर्गो देवस्य धीमही। bhargo devasya dhīmahī | = Madhya Kuta
धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्॥ dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt || = Sakti Kuta 

So there you go - the connection between the Gayatri Mantra and Pancadasi Mantra.
