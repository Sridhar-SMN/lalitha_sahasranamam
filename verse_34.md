The story embedded here is the burnt manmatha (god of love) was resurrected by the Divine mother using Sanjivani (yes, the same herb that Hanumanji got for Lakshmana in Ramayana - looks like the ancient days equivalent of Dolo 650)

Of course the story is for LKG students and you can guess we Advaitins will be able to twist anything and everything to Brahman and Maya. Manmatha represents desires and the third eye of Shiva represents knowledge (by the way the 3rd eye is not a physical eye like we see in movies). The real meaning is that liberation means knowing the inner self which is possible only by eradication of ignorance or avidyā. When ignorance is removed, what remains is knowledge or vidyā. That is why the worship of Lalithambike is called Śrī Vidyā. Burning of Manmatha is the removal of avidyā and his resurrection is para vidyā - the ultimate knowledge. Manmatha before his killing was an embodiment of avidyā that mainly comprises of ego and resurrected Manmatha was with pure knowledge. His ego was burnt by Śiva and knowledge was given to him by Śaktī.
