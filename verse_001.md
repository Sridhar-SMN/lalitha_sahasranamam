# Nama 1

nama 1/1000 - Apr 5 

‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ- ≈õrƒ´mƒÅtƒÅ

The Supreme mother as the substratum and creator/sustainer/dissolver of the universe is how LS begins. When Sri is added as a prefix to any word, it shows the greatness (every rule has an exception and i stand as the shining example of that exception to this rule üôÇ) . The human mother goes great lengths including sacrificing everything at her disposal for the sake of her child but does not have the special power to alleviate the child's sufferings and miseries (scriptures call it Tapatrayam - 3 fires) . Worshiping the Goddess as divine mother is acknowledging that with  Her grace we will be able to overcome this samsara with ease and gain the necessary courage to swim through effortlessly.  As Spji says in one of his speeches - God does not have any grandchildren and hence she is Srimata to all. 

As we go forward in LS, you will notice that the ultimate prayer is to grant us "fearlessness" and not somehow magically rewrite the prarabdh of this birth and load it on some other poor bloke. Again quoting Spji - The person who you think you are will never be free from the prarabdh of this birth, but You will be free of that person. 

Saint Durvasa prays to Sri Mata saying " Oh ! SriMata ! the Supreme compassionate ! I had been born to a number of mothers. In the future also, I will/may be born to a number of mothers. My mothers are countless, as I had a different mother for my different births. I am so scared to be born again and again and to undergo the associated sufferings (Here Swami Vivekananda says even what is so called punyam is nothing but being bound by a gold chain keeping us firmly in this rebirth cycle). Oh ! Mata ! I am surrendering to you. Please give me releif from my future births" 

It is very pertinent to note that LS begins by addressing Lalithambike as the mother of all, which emphasizes Her compassion for the universe and its beings.  And this concept of compassion is not alien to other scriptures.  In what is probably the most touching sloka of the Gita, in 10.11 Lord says ‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡§æ‡§Æ‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§ï‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§Æ‡§π‡§Æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§ú‡§Ç ‡§§‡§Æ: = Out of compassion for them, I, who dwell within their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance, with the luminous lamp of knowledge = by giving us the right guru who will lead us to our goal.


# Nama 2/1000 - Apr 6

‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•Ä - ≈õrƒ´mahƒÅrƒÅj√±ƒ´

While the first nama referred to the divine mother as the creator, this nama brings out the Goddess as the sustainer.  You will note the "Sri" prefix continues here too.  The concept mentioned here is very similar to the concept of creator, sustainer in Gita slokas 9.04 to 9.08.  We will use those principles for a later nama. 

Essentially that as Brahman or Para Prakriti, the Divine mother in her higher nature is the sustainer/Adhistanam of the Mithya Universe.  Or if you take the Dvaita traditions then as the Sustainer the Divine Mother is the provider to all and as the Ishwara tatvam is the ultimate source of all support, benevolence and grace. 

Personally i like to believe in this body/mind complex it is worthwhile and sensible to surrender to the Divine mother thanking 'Her‚Äô for blessing us this apara prakriti and the prarabdh of this birth, while praying to the same Goddess to guide us in this very birth to help us understand the non-dual truth.  Swami P quotes this regularly to highlight the brilliance of Adi Shankaracharya - in Annapoorna Stotram which is the prayer to the Divine Mother as the sustainer (provider of food and nourishment) what do you think is the final prayer with which Acharya ends the Stotram ?

O Mother Annapoorna, You Who are always Full (with the gift of Food and Blessings), You Who are the Beloved of Shiva, O Mother Parvati, Please grant me the Alms of Your Grace, to awaken within me Spiritual Knowledge and Freedom from all Worldly Desires. 

Adi Shankaracharya will not miss a single opportunity to request divine mother‚Äôs grace to entrench Jnanam and Vairagyam.  He ends the Kanakadhara Stotram with a similar prayer. Just sublimely brilliant. 

From the Saguna Brahman/Ishwara /Deity angle there is a very nice interpretation of this nama.  If you notice it is Maharajni (Empress) and not Maharani (Queen).  My historical facts on this are not great but it is said that Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple was the first temple where the divine mother's Maharajni (Empress) status was correctly captured and She was given an independent sannidhi.  I don‚Äôt exactly know the date of origin of the temple at Thirumeychur (where also the Divine Mother Lalithambike has an independent Sannidhi) but more sure that the Madurai temple was constructed with this principle in mind. Later in LS the Goddess will be referred to as "Svathantra" which gets interpreted as not dependent on anything/anyone for support - the support-less supporter of the Universe - we can borrow that concept here to explain "Empress/Maharajni" of this nama.
[1:58 PM, 4/5/2023] Sridhar Gita Class: We are the Atman no doubt but why do we need the grace of the Divine Mother in this birth into this body/mind ?

# nama 3/1000 - Apr 7

‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç-‡§∏‡§ø‡§Ç‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§®‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä - ≈õrƒ´mat-si·πÉhƒÅsane≈õvari

Simhasaneshvari = Simha + Asanam + Isvari.  Lalithambike, the Empress, is sitting on a Lion. This nama, again starting with Sri,  talks of Her role as the supreme dissolver (the first 2 we saw as being the creator & sustainer) .  It is believed that word Simha is flipped version of Himsa which means pain/suffering (like it is said 'Siva' is the flipped version of  'Vas' where Vas = Desire).  Asana has a meaning in Sanskrit equating to expelling and Isvari = powerful ruler.  So the nama stands for ‚ÄòPain/suffering expelling powerful ruler‚Äô in Her role as uplifting of her devotees and also  destroyer of the Universe at Pralayam and Mahapralayam (we will see what these words mean in a later nama - mahapralayasakshini).  

The Devi, in her girlhood, seated on a lion, slew Mahisa, an Asura who represents false pride and his aspect of stealing from the various devatas  is symbolic of our  false pride "stealing" the divine play thru our body/mind when actually we are merely supposed to be the instrument ( nimith of Gita sloka 11.33). Hence she is known as Mahisasuramardhini -  the slayer of Mahisa, the annihilator of our false pride and as Simhasanesvari (the Queen of Queens seated on a lion) - the cosmic dissolver.

‡§ö‡§ø‡§¶‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø-‡§ï‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§°-‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§æ - cidagni-ku·πá·∏ça-sambh≈´tƒÅ

Cit+Agnikunda+Sambuta : Cit= Consciousness (Nirguna Brahman - Original Consciousness - OC), Agni Kunda = Fire altar & Sambuta = Born. This nama has some parallels to Gita sloka 4.37 where Lord Krishna talks about how knowledge of our real nature burns to ashes our ignorance, karma & kartritva (doership). 

Divine mother is the Supreme  Consciousness who dispels ignorance about our true nature.  The whole premise of the Upanishads is we don't know our real nature as Consciousness and somehow have managed to delude ourselves to thinking we are mainly this body/mind which is also conscious somehow. 

Upanishads, Gita and several scriptures like LS are hoping to try to make us flip our perspective on its head.  For the right seeker (or qualified adhikari as Vedanta likes to call it), the divine mother in her higher nature as Chit or Cit, illumininates from within dispelling this ignorance.  Here Sambutha=Born should not be taken in the literal sense that Consciousness is "born" along with birth of the body or somehow Brahman will appear at the moment of Self Realisation and dance in front of our eyes, but to be taken more as "available always even when the body does not exist (Gita 2.20) and also in the mind". Even using the word ‚Äúalways‚Äù is wrong usage as it somehow naively suggests Consciousness is bound within some definition of time, but you get the drift of what I am trying to say. 

The Brahmanda Purana (the Purana in which Lalitha Sahasranamam appears as the conversation between Lord Hayagriva and Sage Agasthya) has a beautiful imagery and story to capture this nama.  The Purana  after describing how Indra was persecuted by Bhand√§sursa (more on Bhandasura when we discuss verse 31 onwards) , says: "Then he constructed a very beautiful sacrificial altar (agni kunda) and the Devas offered the flesh of their body as oblations (equatable to offering our actions and our mind to the Divine mother - arpan buddhi and prasad buddhi). When the Devas were about to offer up the whole of their bodies there appeared a great blaze of light, bright as millions of suns and cool as millions of moons put together (Consciousness is self revealing into the purified mind of the seeker); in the midst of this light was seen an indescribable wheel-form of Sricakra and from its centre arose the great Devi shining like the morning sun (I dont know for sure if this has any connection to the blaze of light that is described in Keno Upanishad where again the Divine mother schools Indra and gives him Atma Jnanam).  On beholding the great Devi, the Consciousness of all which now stood self revelaed, Indra and the Devas were filled with ecstasy and they bowed down to her again and again."

‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø-‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§æ - devakƒÅrya-samudyatƒÅ

This nama has a very close resemblance to Gita sloka 4.08 (‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§®‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∂‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§ö ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç : paritrƒÅ·πáƒÅya sƒÅdh≈´nƒÅ·πÅ vinƒÅ≈õhƒÅya cha du·π£hk·πõitƒÅm = To protect the righteous & to annihilate the wicked).  This nama of LS translates to "manifested herself for fulfilling the objectives of the devas" .

Even though most of the Puranic stories on the Devi are related to Her slaying some demon or the other, a close observation of this nama will show you the primary purpose of any manifestation/avatara is for the upliftment of the "good folks" and all this war and slaying of the "bad fellows" is only an incidental secondary task - it does appear violent action flicks were more popular than satvic plays even 5000 years back üòä. SPji in his lecture on Gita sloka 4.08 beautifully explains avatara theory and highlights this very point. 

By necessity in her manifestation she also slays the Asuras (Bhandasura and Mahisasura types - as we saw each of these Asuras have a real significance and they are not some crazy wicked chaps meant to be quoted just in some Amar Chitra Katha comics - they are alive and kicking inside us daily).  Though eternal, she is said to be born whenever she manifests herself for the accomplishment of the objectives of the Devas. 

Here ‚ÄòDevas‚Äô to be interpreted as the sincere seeker who is Sadhana Chatushtaya Sampanna adhikari (Viveka, Viragya, Shat Sampathi and Mumukshutvam) , who having done selfless karma yoga and achieved ekagrata (concentration) thru sincere devotion to his/her ishta devata is all set to receive this grace.  The Divine mother is very much here within us in this body/mind itself  to vacuum clean away anything (the asuras within) that might detract us from realising Her as the ever present ultimate prize. 

SPji explains this in the audio which I shared last week - it is ONLY with the grace of the divine mother that will we be able to propel ahead overcoming the enormous weight of our past karmas and as devakƒÅrya-samudyatƒÅ, Lalithambike is there here in us to make that happen ## 

This nama also serves as the bridge shifting the focus from the  Prakasa (unmanifest) to the Vimarsa (manifest) aspect of the Divine Mother and will segue nicely into the next few slokas which describe Her Vimarsa aspect.

This completes verse 1 and tomorrow we will start with verse 2.

Footnotes 

1. A brief note on  the topic of Sadhana Chatushtayam (& what we mean by a qualified person/seeker) -  pls refer to this link . 

https://sriramanamaharishi.com/my_keywords/sadhana-chatushtaya/

2. ## I want to clarify as to why I have highlighted "ONLY" in bold . There is no suggestion that one manifested form of the Lord is superior to another or any form is inferior . In LS it is Lalithambike, Bhagavad Gita it is Krishna, Ramayan it is Rama,  Thirupugazh it is Muruga, Shiva Puranam it is Shiva, Devi Mahatmyam it is Durga and so on. Pls feel free  to replace "Lalithambike" with your Ishta Devata as you go thru these posts. The learnings are far more important than the form of the Lord/Goddess - Lord Krishna cant stop saying in the Gita that the ultimate test of progress is when we are able to see everyone as the same reality (Gita 18.20) . The only fervent hope of the scriptures is that we will gradually migrate from seeing God just as Eka Rupa (a single form ) ‚Äî> Aneka Rupa (it is the same God appearing as different forms) ‚Äî> Vishwaroopa (it is the same one God appearing as this universe) ‚Äî> Arupa Ishwara (Nirguna Brahman) and finally ‚Äî> understanding Tat Tvam Asi to realise God is not different to us in our real nature. The real end is to land at God is never away from us. A very wise friend from Michigan said this to me - ‚Äúdo you know why in the highest point of devotion or surrender we close our eyes, fold our hands and bow our head down towards our chest ?‚Äù She continued - ‚ÄúIt is because deep down and somehow instinctively we know (but can never express it well in words or is forgotten once the eyes open) that the Real God resides inside of us and is the ever present Consciousness‚Äù .
