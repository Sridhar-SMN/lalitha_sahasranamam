Visanga and Visukra are the two brothers of Bhanda. The Brahmanda Purana. says: "Once Bhandäsura, the head of the Asuras, desired to create different kinds of Asuras. From his right shoulder he created Visukra, who was able to protect the company of the Daityas and who was equal to Sukra (the Guru of Asuras in the matter of counselling), and from his left shoulder, he created VisangA. Vārāhī Devi slayed Viśukra and Lalithambike was happy with the bravery of Vārāhī Devi.

This nama talks about the “birth” of Lord Ganesha. In the nama there is a word “Kalpitha” which roughly equates to “imagined”. Later when we see the nama “Maya” will come back to this word. Since all of you know the story and concept of Lord Ganesha will include below only something that might be new to some of you.

Gaṇeśhā was born out of a mere glance of Lalithambike at Kāmeśvara. Gaṇeśhā is the first son of Śiva and Pārvathī. Bhandāsura during the war was witnessing the destruction of his army. In order to avoid further causalities to his army he ordered a yantra by name jaya vignaṁ to be kept in the midst of the army of the Divine Mother. Yantras are powerful, only if impregnated with potency of mantras. When this yantra was kept, the army of Lalithambike started losing their self- confidence. Mantrinī Devi, who is an authority of mantras, noticed this and reported to Divine Mother. This yantra can be removed by the one who has won over puryaṣṭaka (Puri astaka - the 8 cities) which consists of the following eight- 1) five organs of action (karmendriyas), 2) five organs of senses (jñānaendriyas), 3) antaḥkaraṇa (four in numbers - manas, buddhi, cittam and ahaṃkāra), 4) five prāṇas (prāṇa, apāṇa, etc), 5) five elements (ākāś, air, etc) 6) desire, 7) ignorance and 8) karma. The total components of puryaṣṭaka are twenty seven and with this the attributes of Śiva is added, takes the total to twenty eight. The mūla mantra of Mahā Gaṇapati is twenty eight. When all the twenty seven components of puryaṣṭaka are destroyed, it leads to attributes of Śiva.

The word Jiva also means the man possessed of the identity of Ahamkara and of the idea that he directs the Puryastakas. When these ideas are destroyed by his knowledge of the (true) lord of the Puryastaka, which knowledge is created by ascertaining the true nature of his own self, then as there are no qualities there is nothing to be qualified. Hence Lord Ganesha is also called Vigneshwara - The ishwara of Vignams/obstacles. Which also explains why every activity/ project/prayer/yagya beings with a prayer to Lord Ganesha.

Footnote : And we won’t have the Bhagavad Gita without Lord Ganesha.  He is the first one to have understood and transcribed it and still some of us dont invoke Lord Ganesha in our Gita invocations - wierd to say the least - ignorance within ignorance !!  

Pls google and read the story of Sage Vyasa (who himself is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) praying to Ganesha to be the scribe and the cute terms of agreement they sign 😀
