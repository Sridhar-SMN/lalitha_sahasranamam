The sweet melody of her words put to shame the Kacchapi (Vina of Sarasvati).

Saundarya Laharī (verse 66) says: “While Vāni (Sarasvatī) is singing with veena about the various glorious deeds of Śiva and you begin to express words of appreciation, nodding your head, Sarasvatī quickly covers Her veena in its case. The sweetness on the strings of the veena is wholly trumpted by the soft melody of your eulogistic words.” 

I have to apologise here that I have not been able to find out more on the deeper meaning of this nama.  If any of you know anything else on this pls feel free to let me know and I will share here. 

मन्दस्मित-प्रभापूर-मज्जत्कामेश-मानसा -mandasmita-prabhāpūra-majjatkāmeśa-mānasā

Smita means smile and mandasmita means a special benevolent smile. Kāmeśa is Śiva. When Lalitai is sitting on the left thigh of Śiva, they are known as Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvarī. This form is different from their Ardhanārīśvara form. Śiva is immersed in that beautiful special smile of Lalitambika.  Kama also could mean desire in this context and the nama is probably also suggesting that the smile of the Divine mother blesses the sincere seeker and enables him replace all desires and rest in the bliss of Her / His own divine nature (maybe Gita 2.55 can be equated to this here but I cant be sure other than to make an educated guess and say the 2 are more or less the same)
