From Nama 8 and 9 it is clear the Divine mother takes care of the 2 main ‚Äúenemies‚Äù and as such now the mind is purer and less messed up. The traditional function of the mind - Sankalpa (how one thinks) and Vikalpa (doubting/debating) - are now nicely streamlined thanks to blessing of the previous 2 namas and when such a mind is squeezed what is left is the sweet juice of sugarcane depicted by the Bow in the hand of the Divine mother.  From sugarcane the sweetest juice can be enjoyed. The same way when Lalithambike has her reign on our minds we do understand the sweetest reality of Saguna and Nirguna nature.  Mano = mind, Ikshu = Sugar cane & Kodanda = Bow. Another interpretation takes this nama as Samashti mind of the manifested aspect of the Divine mother.  This makes a lot of sense as both Mind (Anthakarana) and the next nama on Tanmatras essentially are in their subtle form (sukshma rupa) the Sattva aspect of Maya (Sakthi of Brahman) as per creation theory. For details pls refer Tattva Bodha.

This is the traditional way many books describe this nama and it sounded reasonable but honestly for  me it felt somewhat Bollywoodish. No usage of a prop in any scripture is without an appropriate reason. All this sugarcane juice thingy seemed somewhat suspect to me but then I am no authority so pls read below with a heavy pinch of salt. 

I personally feel the concept of Bow in the Upanishads presents a very different interpretation for this Nama.  Mundaka Upanishad has the archery example and the Bow is representative of Scriptures.  The Upanishad says - Paramatma is the target, Jivatma is the arrow and the Bow is the Sastram/Scripture upon which the Arrow is placed and aimed at the target üéØ.  The learning is that the arrow does not need to travel spatially but realise that in essence Jivatma and Paramatma are one and the same. 

Therefore indicating that with appropriate Shravanam, Mananam & Nidhidyasanam the qualified seeker (represented by the sharpened arrow) will achieve its goal of ‚Äúreaching‚Äù the Paramatma.  And the Divine mother will open doors to the right scripture at the right time (some of us who regularly chant LS or VS or any prayer sincerely can personally vouch for this) and She will also send you the Guru you need (again we can vouch for this) . So my take is this nama is the grace of the divine mother when she ‚Äúloads our minds on the Bow of Sastram (scripture)‚Äù and also gives us the appropriate archer (guru) who will guide us towards our ultimate purpose. 

Even though the earlier sugar cane juice version makes sense, I personally like the Bow = Scripture way of interpreting this and hope you will agree it is not too preposterous or far fetched.  

In my defense, I quote the mantra from Mundaka Upanishad with humble pranams to Swami P for bringing it to life.  An added point to the archery imagery is that the string of the bow needs to be pulled in first before shooting the arrow, which actually represents that with devotion to the Divine Mother our minds become internally focused and stops roaming distracted by the outside bling bling.

Take the Upanishad as the bow , the great weapon and place upon it the arrow sharpened by concerted effort and Then, having drawn it back with a mind directed to the thought of Brahman, strike that mark, O my good friend-that which is the Imperishable.

As we discussed yesterday the grace of the Lord/Divine mother always manifests as the Guru and Sastram (scriptres) 

Not a great cross connection but somewhat even in the Bhagavad Gita every time Arjuna lets slip the Bow his sense of purpose and direction is lost (1.27, 1.49 &   2.09).
