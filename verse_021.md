51. सर्वाभरण-भूषिता - sarvābharaṇa-bhūṣitā
52. शिव-कामेश्वराङ्कस्था - śiva-kāmeśvarāṅkasthā 
53. शिवा - siva *
54. स्वाधीन-वल्लभा  - svādhīna-vallabhā

* fans of Vishnu Sahasranamam (VS) will note this is nama 27 & 600 in VS. Apart from the obvious Saguna Ishwara image reference of Lord Shiva this nama has a very deep significance and occupies the “center” of Maha Rudram (in fact it is the exact middle word of the entire Rig Veda), the pivotal word in Mandukya Upanishad which according to Lord Rama is the only Upanishad we need to study and the key word in Thiruvasagam (Tamil). We will use this nama to understand the true meaning of the mantra “Namah Shivaya”.

## Verse 21 - namas 49 & 50 - May 16 

## 49. सर्वारुणा - sarvāruṇā

Sarvam + aruṇam = everything in red. Everything associated with Her is red. If you remember we started with the invocation sloka where the first words was "Aruna" -  अरुणां करुणातरङ्गिताक्षीं and in a subsequent nama we debated whether or not to overcomplicate Aruna to mean light and therefore Consciousness but postponed that torture to when dealing with Nirguna Svarupam. We will maintain that discipline especially given this is the last sloka which describes the Saguna Svarupam.  Basically everything associated with the Divine Mother is "Red" and just to do something different we took a green saree as offering during our last visit to the temple @ Thirumeychur.  Even the Divine Mother needs a change in uniform once in a while. 

and again, another clarion call to the Chinese to switch spiritual loyalties 🙂

## 50. अनवद्याङ्गी - anavadyāṅgī

Every part of Her body is flawless and in accordance with samudrikā lakśana or śāstra. She is nirguṇa Brahman (without attributes) as well as saguṇa Brahman (with attributes). When She is known as saguṇa Brahman She is with form and attributes. Saguṇa Brahman is discussed here in this nama. As Swami P says the difference between a Jiva and an Avatara - Avatara descends into the form and has full control over the Maya/Prakriti and always aware of His/Her true nature, but the Jiva falls into birth completely oblivious of the trappings of Prakriti/Maya (as highlighted by Lord Krishna in BG 3.27 and 7.13)

## verse 21 - namas 51 & 52  - May 17

## 51. सर्वाभरण-भूषिता - sarvābharaṇa-bhūṣitā

She is adorned with all types of ornaments. The Kālika Purāṇa mentions forty types of ornaments. Parasurāma Kalpa Sūtra, one of the authoritative texts on Śrī Cakra pūja (ritual worship) mentions more number of ornaments that adorn Her.  Though many believe that the description of her physical form ends with this nāma, some scholars are of the opinion that physical description ends with nāma 55 only. However 48 to 51 describe Her form of prakāśa and vimarśa combined.

## 52. शिव-कामेश्वराङ्कस्था - śiva-kāmeśvarāṅkasthā

Her seating posture begins from this nāma. She sits on the left thigh of Śiva. This is the form of saguṇa Brahman. Śiva is prakāśa form and self illuminating and Śaktī is His vimarśa form. It is good to meditate upon this posture of Them. Why She is sitting on his left thigh? Heart is on the left side and She is said to be Śiva’s heart (could also mean love).
Kāma here means divine desire/knowledge, Śiva means auspicious & Īśvara means the supreme ruler. Knowledge is said to be the form of Śiva.  Here all the qualities of the saguṇa Brahman are covered.  This saguṇa Brahman is called Śaktī or prakāśa vimarśa mahā māyā svarūpinī. 

Kama as desire of the Brahman to "create" the universe is executed through Śaktī, the auspicious form of the Supreme ruler Śiva. This nāma actually talks about static and kinetic form of energies in unison. This also could mean the creation of the universe. As we saw earlier this is different to Ardhanaree form of Lord Shiva and hence do take note when you use this nama for meditation. The Ardhanaree image is a lot more involved to explain and we will cover it  later and the same is beautifully explained by Lord Krishna in the 13th chapter of the Gita. 

The reason for capturing "create" within quotes is to highlight that it actually is a fallacy to call it creation. This nama above captures this very concept of "creation" and is wonderful nama for meditation. As Lord Krishna explains in Gita 9.08 even as Isvara he does not/cannot create anything and it is merely unmanifest to manifest to unmanifest all ruled by Anaadhi Avidya/Maya with Brahman as subtratum driven helplelessly by laws of Prakriti. 

प्रकृतिं स्वामवष्टभ्य विसृजामि पुन: पुन: |
भूतग्राममिमं कृत्स्नमवशं प्रकृतेर्वशात् || 

prakṛitiṁ svām avaṣhṭabhya visṛijāmi punaḥ punaḥ
bhūta-grāmam imaṁ kṛitsnam avaśhaṁ prakṛiter vaśhāt

Meaning : Resorting to  My own prakrti under My control, I project forth again and again the whole of this multitude of beings (the diverse universe) which are powerless owing to the influence of (their own) nature . In Sanskrit grammar when a word is used twice, like पुन: (punah) here, then it represents unending/infinity. Which is also why we can never ask the question as to when creation first began and by extension when did our first karma begin.  Keep pondering on this longer and deeper and you will see Karma theory has huge holes in it and suddenly Mithyathva of everything will begin to make sense. But that torture we will reserve for a later nama.

## Addendum

(Surreptitiously i have introduced all of you to Mandukya Karikas audio series of Swami Sarvapriyananda - if there is one lecture on Upanishads that is a compulsory listen then it is this.  Granted it is Phd level but then why waste this birth by not listening to this given Lord Rama says this is the only Upanishad one needs to know)

## verse 21 - namas 53  - May 18

## शिवा - 53. shiva/siva  

To explain this nama I will cut/paste 2 explanations and one more from my notes on Upanishads. Essentially using the nama the Nirguna Brahman tatvam of Lalithambike is explained.

(1) given by none other than Adi Shankaracharya from his commentary on Vishnu Sahasranamam (VS) . Shiva/Siva = The Pure - He is Pure, being free from the three qualities. Hari alone is praised by 'Siva' and other names, there being no difference between him and them.  Nama 600 of VS is also Shiva/Siva and there it is used to explain the concept of "purifier". Knowledge of Shiva/Siva purifies the mind removing the ignorance. 

(2) From the Siva agamas answering the question 'Who is Siva ?'  - Witness to the modifications (of the mind), who is there before the arising of such modifications, who is in the moditications about to rise, who is the cause of sensation, who is the support of all false and inert matter, who is consciousness itself, who is beloved of all, who is bliss itself, who is the means of obtaining all, who is connected with all, the Omnipresent is called Siva. The Self-shining, pure being who is devoid of the distinction of Jiva. Isa, etc., is Siva."

(3) In Mandukya Upanishad in mantra 7, Nirguna Brahman is termed "Shiva/Siva" and there it is used to convey "bliss/Ananda" ( and not to worry for the Krishna Bakthas - in Atma Bindu Upanishad - Brahman is called Vasudeva - Vasanthi sarvani bhutahni iti Vasuhu, Chith rupena prakashayiti iti devaha - therefore Vasudeva = Sat Chith roopa Brahman.  Lord Krishna borrows this concept in Gita 7.19 and says Vasudeva Sarvam Iti. Lord Krishna is no megalomaniac or on some ego trip to claim that his Avatra is everything but given He has has no confusion on his status as Brahman he boldly claims everything is nothing but Vasudeva) 

Coming back to the LS nama - There are two important points mentioned here. One is that, Lalithambike  is in no way different from Śiva. Both Śiva and Śaktī are in a single "form" only. Only out of ignorance, we worship them as two separate deities (the ending sloka of LS actually talks about their one unified svarupam) . Secondly, assuming that we continue to worship Her individual form that has been described in the above verses, still we get all auspicious things = bliss/purification = She will lead us to a Guru, who will lead us to the right scripture and the scripture will lead us to our real nature.  No prarabdh rewriting and PC Sorcar type instant magic. same old drill and no escaping that.  

Pls refer footnote for explanation on "Namah Shivaya" 

----------

Namah Shivaya - I will make a quick highlight.  While Shiva/Siva is the name attributed to the Lord the deeper significance of the word Shiva = Bliss / Pure Knowledge / Purity.  In Mandukya Upanishad the Nirguna Brahman is referred to as "Shiva" in sloka 7.  An authority no less than Lord Rama considered the Mandukya as the only Upanishad that needs to be studied and should we miss that opportunity in this life then we are required to do 108 other Upanishads. (There is a brilliant Youtube playlist on Mandukya by Swami Sarvapriyanda - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2imXor63HtRJbtP4mMt-Q2ke8XOkL7pX)

Aham Brahmasmi is in singular while Na Ma Si Va Ya (Namah Sivaya) is the plural version highlighting the ability for all Jivas to realise Brahman  . 

So the phrase "Na ma" = Aham  (na = ahankaram , ma = mamakaram and with a play on na as NO the individual is negated) = negating the individual identity and arriving at the essential nature of the Jiva = Tvam padha lakshyartha as the Vedantins will term it - the true nature of us as Jiva which is nothing but Brahman covered extensively in 2nd chapter and 7th chapter of Gita (verse 2.13, 2.17 & 7.05  are good sources for reference)

Sivam = Higher nature of Saguna Brahman = Para Prakriti of the Gita = Brahman of the Upanishads = Supreme Brahman in Mandukya and saiva sidhantam (Tamil) = Tat padha lakshyartha as the Vedantins will term it = Nirguna Brahman

Aa ya : singular 'asmi' in sanskrit/tamil grammar becomes 'aa ya' in plural 

Therefore Namah Shivaya  is a prayer which can be captured as -  May all the Jivas following the sincere path of as laid down by the scriptures realise their true nature as  Brahman

Namah Shivaya is the plural of the Mahavakyam ‘Aham Brahmasmi’. (due credit to a great guru from Bangalore who explained this in his discourse on the Tamil Siva Puranam which starts with the words - Namah Shivaya)

## 54. स्वाधीन-वल्लभा  - svādhīna-vallabhā - May 19

Her consort (Śiva) belongs to Her alone essentially to mean that Maya is "power" of Brahman and one does not operate without the other. Now here the Divine Mother is presented as Brahman and Siva as Maya.  It is not controversial at all as between them they don’t care who you call Brahman and who Maya. No wonder Lord Krishna gets fed up in Gita 9.11 and calls those of us “fools” for not wanting to understand both His Saguna and Nirguna form. 

Yesterday was listening to a Swami P’s lecture on Kaivalya Upanishad and he beautifully captured this concept.  Brief notes from the lecture below - the full video link here - https://youtu.be/978uFC6m28g

Is Brahman Nirguna or Saguna ? 

With Maya as an attribute Brahman is Saguna but remember even the attribute is Mithya (does not have an independent reality). With Mithya attribute Brahman is Sagunam but by itself Brahman is Nirgunam.  So the answer is Brahman is both Sagunam and Nirgunam. From a vyavaharika angle Brahman is Sagunam and from Paramarthika angle Brahman is Nirguna. 

The puzzling thing about the concept of Maya in the Bhagavad Gita is you would expect it will be found in many places, but not really. The word only appears twice in 7.14 and 7.15 . Lord tries this back door in 9.04 to 9.06 and again in 15.03 but not easy to unearth. Lord mostly sticks to Para and Apara Prakriti or Purusha/Prakriti paradigm. 

The concept of Maya comes later in the LS and we will cover it there.

(In many places in LS, Lalithambike will be presented as Nirguna Brahman and I have borrowed that here to get the ball rolling. Same with every scripture. Each scripture will glorify its deity to a higher status. The individual deities themselves are agnostic but as Swami P says in the audio above only we humans confuse the topic and claim one form is superior to another. As mentioned in nama 9 (Apr 17) the form we use to depict Saguna Brahman is not a material discussion. The greater emphasis is trying to get the essence of both the Saguna and Nirguna aspect)
