* fans of Vishnu Sahasranamam (VS) will note this is nama 27 & 600 in VS. Apart from the obvious Saguna Ishwara image reference of Lord Shiva this nama has a very deep significance and occupies the “center” of Maha Rudram (in fact it is the exact middle word of the entire Rig Veda), the pivotal word in Mandukya Upanishad which according to Lord Rama is the only Upanishad we need to study and the key word in Thiruvasagam (Tamil). We will use this nama to understand the true meaning of the mantra “Namah Shivaya”.

## Verse 21 - namas 49 & 50 - May 16 

सर्वारुणा - sarvāruṇā

Sarvam + aruṇam = everything in red. Everything associated with Her is red. If you remember we started with the invocation sloka where the first words was "Aruna" -  अरुणां करुणातरङ्गिताक्षीं and in a subsequent nama we debated whether or not to overcomplicate Aruna to mean light and therefore Consciousness but postponed that torture to when dealing with Nirguna Svarupam. We will maintain that discipline especially given this is the last sloka which describes the Saguna Svarupam.  Basically everything associated with the Divine Mother is "Red" and just to do something different we took a green saree as offering during our last visit to the temple @ Thirumeychur.  Even the Divine Mother needs a change in uniform once in a while. 

and again, another clarion call to the Chinese to switch spiritual loyalties 🙂

अनवद्याङ्गी - anavadyāṅgī

Every part of Her body is flawless and in accordance with samudrikā lakśana or śāstra. She is nirguṇa Brahman (without attributes) as well as saguṇa Brahman (with attributes). When She is known as saguṇa Brahman She is with form and attributes. Saguṇa Brahman is discussed here in this nama. As Swami P says the difference between a Jiva and an Avatara - Avatara descends into the form and has full control over the Maya/Prakriti and always aware of His/Her true nature, but the Jiva falls into birth completely oblivious of the trappings of Prakriti/Maya (as highlighted by Lord Krishna in BG 3.27 and 7.13)
