श्रीमत्-सिंहासनेश्वरी - śrīmat-siṃhāsaneśvari

Simhasaneshvari = Simha + Asanam + Isvari.  Lalithambike, the Empress, is sitting on a Lion. This nama, again starting with Sri,  talks of Her role as the supreme dissolver (the first 2 we saw as being the creator & sustainer) .  It is believed that word Simha is flipped version of Himsa which means pain/suffering (like it is said 'Siva' is the flipped version of  'Vas' where Vas = Desire).  Asana has a meaning in Sanskrit equating to expelling and Isvari = powerful ruler.  So the nama stands for ‘Pain/suffering expelling powerful ruler’ in Her role as uplifting of her devotees and also  destroyer of the Universe at Pralayam and Mahapralayam (we will see what these words mean in a later nama - mahapralayasakshini).  

The Devi, in her girlhood, seated on a lion, slew Mahisa, an Asura who represents false pride and his aspect of stealing from the various devatas  is symbolic of our  false pride "stealing" the divine play thru our body/mind when actually we are merely supposed to be the instrument ( nimith of Gita sloka 11.33). Hence she is known as Mahisasuramardhini -  the slayer of Mahisa, the annihilator of our false pride and as Simhasanesvari (the Queen of Queens seated on a lion) - the cosmic dissolver.
