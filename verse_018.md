## 41. इन्द्रगोप-परिक्षिप्त-स्मरतूणाभ-जङ्घिका  -  indragopa-parikṣipta-smaratūṇābha-jaṅghikā

Her calf muscles look like the quiver of Manmatha, the god of love. Saundarya Laharī (verse 83) says “In order to win the heart of your Lord Śiva, the five arrowed cupid God of love has made your legs into an arrow case with ten arrows (toe nails).”

The arch of her feet is more beautiful and curvier than tortoise’s shell. But Adi Shankaracharya in Soundarya Lahiri expresses his anger for comparing Her feet to that of tortoise shell, which is hard. He says in SL,  “The toes of your feet is the one that sustains this universe (he is not even comparing the entire feet, he says only about the toes). Lord Śiva knows the softness of your feet that is why He held your feet with great care during your marriage ceremony. How dare they (possibly Vāc Devis) compare such soft feet to that of tortoise shell?” 

My only arguement to support the Vāc Devis and to calm my Mahaguru Shankara is to take shelter under Gita sloka 2.58 where there is a reference to Tortoise & its shell 

यदा संहरते चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वश: |
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ||

yadā sanharate chāyaṁ kūrmo ’ṅgānīva sarvaśhaḥ
indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣhṭhitā

Meaning : And when one fully withdraws the senses from the objects of the senses, as a tortoise wholly (withdraws) the limbs into its shell, then his wisdom remains established.

It is likely that Vac Devis were saying the grace of the divine mother operated like what Lord Krishna explained as Stith Pragya lakshana to Arjuna in the Gita by helping the seeker to perfect the control of senses - One who is able to withdraw the senses from their objects, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell, is established in stable wisdom.  So this verse of LS is probably alluding that the divine mother blesses the seeker specifically with one aspect of achieving Sadhana Chatushtaya Sampathi - Dama = control of the senses which is 1/6 in Shat Sampathi - for detailed explanation of Sadhana Chatustayam pls refer post dated April 11th on nama # 5
