She wears a red silk cloth around Her waist. Red colour means compassion. Everything associated with Her is red in colour, indicating that Her form is full of compassion (one of the reasons of being Śrī Mātā). It can be said that She performs Her three acts (creation, sustenance and dissolution) with compassion. This could also refer to one of the Vāc Devi-s, Arunā. This Lalitha Sahasranāma was composed by eight Vāc Devi-s under the supervision and blessings of Goddess Lalithambike sitting in the assembly. They are Vasini, Kāmeśvari (not Śiva ’s wife), Modhini, Vimalā, Arunā, Jainī, Sarveśvariī and Koulinī. Arunā Vāc Devi is in Her waist.
