Her eyes appear like fishes moving in a pond. Her face is compared to a pond and Her eyes to fishes. Fishes move very quickly. She also moves Her eyes quickly as She has to shower Her grace on the entire universe. The fish eggs become fertile by mere glance of mother fish. In the same manner She by Her mere glance nourishes the universe. Because of the beauty of Her eyes She is also known as Mīnākṣī, Mīnalocanī, etc. - Those of you who have visited the temple at Madurai will know the Devi is called Meenakshi (fish like eyes which never close - she protects and watches on her devotees 24x7 - the deeper meaning is in Her higher nature, Consciousness is available 24x7)
