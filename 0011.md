# Nama 11/1000 :  Apr 19 

पञ्चतन्मात्र-सायका : pañcatanmātra-sāyakā 

Pañca means five and tanmātra-s are sound, touch, sight, taste and smell, the subtle modifications of the five basic elements space, air, fire, water and earth & Sayaka = arrows.

The earlier nāma spoke about the bow and this nāma talks about Her arrows. She has five arrows. These five arrows are made of flowers. The five flower arrows represent five subtle elements – Tanmatras (Sabda/Sound, Sparsha/Touch, Rupa/Form, Rasa/Taste, Gandha/Smell) which manifest in their gross form as our Jnanendriyas (don’t want to go into Tattva Bodha theory here and will refer you to that text for details) .

These five flowers or arrows are described differently in various tantra śāstra-s and they are meant to represent the 5 qualities that can set us off path - excitement, madness, confusion, stimulation and destruction.  

Again going back to the Mundaka Upanishad quote yesterday,  the Upanishad requires that the mind be undisturbed and compares it with the need for an arrow to be sharp to hit the target.  phal/फल has its origin to this - बाण के आगे का वह धारदार भाग जिससे आघात किया जाता है (the sharp tip of the arrow that pierces is called _फल/Phal). फल/phal in also means fruit or we can take as fruit of devotion to the Divine mother. 

Thru devotion to the divine mother in this nama, She guides us by “arranging” our arrows in the right way and not letting the 5 qualities (stated above) from blunting the arrow . Thus making sure we get the full fruits/फल for our sincere attempts and as such ensuring we get the full benefit from all the scriptural knowledge that one may be blessed with. 

Ultimately the presence of divine thought in our mind and Jnanendriyas is what allows us to take that required pause before responding v. reacting and it is here the Divine mother plays the crucial role of blessing the sincere seeker by being somewhat like a traffic police ensuring a budding vasana is allowed time to incubate in the “green room” before it is enacted on the stage of life.  SPji is big on this “need to take pause using our free will” to filter Vasanas before they become thoughts, words or actions and here is where the blessing of the divine mother allows us that extra 1-2 seconds. 

This is Her right upper hand and Vārāhī Devi is represented by this hand.

(Thank You Alpana for the timely side note explaining the beautiful significance of फल which has proved so valuable to explain this nama 🙏)
