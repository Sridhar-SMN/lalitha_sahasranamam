This is in continuation of the previousnāma. Lord Gaṇeśha was createdto remove the yantra, jaya vignaṁ planted by Bhandāsurā. Lord Gaṇeśhā removed that yantra and helped the army of Lalithambike to regain their self confidence. She was delighted with Gaṇeśa, when he removed the effects of the yantra.  All activities that detract us from our real nature are represented by this yantra of the Puryastakas. Ignorance Māyā is the cause of such acts. This Māyā is caused by the Divine mother  and She alone can remove the veil of māyā.  Once She decides to remove the veil, pure Śiva is realized. But Lalithambike, on Her own, will not remove the veil. She will remove the veil of māyā depending upon one’s efforts and then the whole guru/scripture jing bang will be blessed on us. 

Lord Krishna says this beautifully in Gita sloka 7.14 

दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया | मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते || 
daivī hyeṣhā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā; mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te

Adi Shankaracharya's explanation of this sloka is so beautiful : Hi, since; esa, this, aforesaid; daivi, divine; Maya mama, of Mine, of God, of Visnu, which (Maya) is My own; and which is guna-mayi, constituted by the gunas; is duratyaya, difficult to cross over; therefore, this being so, ye, those who; wholeheartedly prapadyante, take refuge; mam eva, in Me alone, in Me who am the Master of Maya and who am their own Self, by giving up all forms of rites and duties; te, they; taranti, cross over; etam, this; mayam, Maya, which deludes all beings. That is to say, they become freed from the bondage of the world.

She is showering missiles in response to the weapons thrown by Bhandasura.  According to Dhanurveda, the difference between Sastra and Astra is as follows: Sastra is that with which one strikes his enemies. It is always held in hand. Astra is that which is thrown out, or discharged by the hand, as the arrow of a bow. The magic figure of Visukra and the missiles of Bhandasura, refer to the different modifications of nescience (Avidya) - Would refer you back to the Rakthabheeja story that we saw on May 26th  and "Devi showering missiles" means the continuance of the act of divine grace showered to help realising the supreme individuality.
