# nama 6 / 1000 -  Apr 12 


6. उद्यद्भानु-सहस्राभा -  udyadbhānu-sahasrābhā  

From here on for the next few slokas the Vimarasa (manifested) form of the Divine mother is described. This nama says - Her Manifested form shines and is bright like thousands of rising suns.  The complexion of Lalithambike is Red and pretty much in every Purana she is quoted to be this bright red in color (later in LS you will see me struggle when i try to explain why her tongue is also red but that we keep for another day).  

Her Vimarsa form is her physical form and she is worshipped in thousands of forms (an interesting side story is in the Jambukeshwarar temple at Tiruvanikkaval, the divine mother - Akhilandeswari - the goddess of the Universe (Akhilam) as she is named in that temple, is actually dressed and depicted  as Mahalakshmi in the morning, Saraswathi at noon and Durga in the evening) 

In Gita Sloka 11.12, Sanjaya pretty much uses this very nama to describe the physical form of Lord Krishna - If a thousand suns (सूर्यसहस्रस्य -  sūrya-sahasrasya)  blaze forth together in the sky, they would not match the splendour of that great form.
