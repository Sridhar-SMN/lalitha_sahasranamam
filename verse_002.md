# nama 6 / 1000 -  Apr 12 


## 6. उद्यद्भानु-सहस्राभा -  udyadbhānu-sahasrābhā  

From here on for the next few slokas the Vimarasa (manifested) form of the Divine mother is described. This nama says - Her Manifested form shines and is bright like thousands of rising suns.  The complexion of Lalithambike is Red and pretty much in every Purana she is quoted to be this bright red in color (later in LS you will see me struggle when i try to explain why her tongue is also red but that we keep for another day).  

Her Vimarsa form is her physical form and she is worshipped in thousands of forms (an interesting side story is in the Jambukeshwarar temple at Tiruvanikkaval, the divine mother - Akhilandeswari - the goddess of the Universe (Akhilam) as she is named in that temple, is actually dressed and depicted  as Mahalakshmi in the morning, Saraswathi at noon and Durga in the evening) 

In Gita Sloka 11.12, Sanjaya pretty much uses this very nama to describe the physical form of Lord Krishna - If a thousand suns (सूर्यसहस्रस्य -  sūrya-sahasrasya)  blaze forth together in the sky, they would not match the splendour of that great form.

# nama  7 / 1000 -  Apr 13 

## 7. चतुर्बाहु-समन्विता  - caturbāhu-samanvitā

The physical appearance of Lalithambike begins here. This nama simply means - She has four arms . These four arms represent Her ministers, through whom She administers.  These ministers are described in the subsequent four namas. You will notice as we go forward that in the four hands  (chatur bhuj avatar - four hands avatar) and just like in the Gita, the Divine mother is holding something or the other in every hand, each of which represents something spiritually and practically significant. A question that may come to our mind is where is the blessed hand that is supposed to show us the "Abhaya" sign ?  She is not like typical image we see of a deity showing one palm and kind of saying -  "dont worry, i am there & have got your back".   It is here that the brilliance of our Rishis shines through and there is a subsequent nama in LS and a related story on the idol of the Goddess in the Lalithambike temple at Thirumeychur that will reveal a very subtle yet beautiful point.

## Advance preparation for next 2 Namas

Probably the 2 most important namas in our spiritual journey are coming up in 8 and 9. Pretty much every scripture has this and it is borrowed from the Mahanarayana Upanishad. 

Lord Krishna borrows this concept heavily into the Gita and quotes this as  the “2 enemies of life” to be overcome. We will see how with Lalithambike’s blessing we conquer them. The Kamokarsheet Japam  (jaap) orginally from the Mahanarayana Upanishad and in this mantra Kamoekarsheet Manyurakarsheet Namo namaha both Desire (Kama) and Anger (Manyu) are raised to a special  status and salutations is given to them. Even gods are bound to  these qualities. ‘Kamokarsheet’ in Sanskrit means ‘those acts that are out of desire’.‘Manyurakarsheet’   means “those acts that are committed out of anger”.

A wise Jnani (when he was a little boy) was always doing a particular japam and here goes the story : 

Many great scholars at Kanchipuram were always surprised to see the small boy sitting in the corner of the temple and murmuring something. Once, they all decided to question the boy and get an idea about what he is doing all these days. They all went and called to him.

"Oh Boy ! What are you doing" - they asked. An immediate reply came: 

" I need to get rid of my Karma ; So I am doing Japam for that"

The scholars never expected such a mature reply from a small boy. 

"What are you chanting for this purpose?"

The little boy again gave an astounding reply  : 

"Kamokarsheet namo namah: Kamokarsheet
kamah karoti naaham karomi
kamah karta naham karta
kamah kaarayitaa naham kaarayita;
Esha the kaama kaamaaya swaha:

Manyurakaarsheet namo namah: Manyuh akaarsheet
manyuh karoti naham karomi
manyuh karta naham karta
manyuh kaarayita naham kaarayita;
Esha the manyo manyave swaha:"

I have  completed half my target, and I am yet to complete the remaining to get rid of my Karma, he said. He then explained the significance of the statement and also its actual meaning.

"Desire performed the act. Desire did the act. Desire is doing the act, not I (Self). Desire is the agent not I. Desire causes the doer to act not I. O Desire, fascinating in form, let this oblation be offered to thee, Hail!

Anger performed the act. Anger did the act. Anger is doing the act; not I. Anger is the agent; not I. Anger causes the doer to act; not I. O Anger, let this oblation be offered to thee. Hail! " 

The small boy suggested to the veteran scholars 

"Dear Sirs, even you people start chanting this; Only this can kill karma. - And without getting rid of Desire and Anger; which cause Kartritva (doership) & hence Karma, how can you qualify for Moksha (salvation) ?" 

The scriptures call this the shift to the Nivrithi marga from the Pravriti marga  - this also forms the central theme of young Nachiketha’s challenge to his father and his subsequent interaction with Lord Yama in Katho Upanishad. Lord Yama is so impressed that he renames the highest form of yagya in the Vedas as  ‘Nachiketha Yagya’ . Lord Krishna in the Gita borrows heavily from Katho Upanishad and in many places directly does a cut/paste of the Upanishad’s mantras into the Gita. 

In Rudram where Lord Shiva is hailed as Lord Manyu (the Lord of Anger)  the concluding prayer is the famous Maha-Mrityunjaya Mantra 

त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् ।
उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनात् मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् || 

Try-Ambakam Yajaamahe 
Sugandhim Pusstti-Vardhanam
Urvaarukam-Iva Bandhanaan 
Mrtyor-Mukssiiya Maa-[A]mrtaat ||

This normally gets translated as : 

1: We Worship the Tryambaka (the Three-Eyed One), 
2: Who is Fragrant (as the Spiritual Essence), Increasing the Nourishment (of our Spiritual Core);
3: From these many Bondages (of Samsara) similar to Cucumbers (tied to their Creepers),
4: May I be Liberated from Death (Attachment to Perishable Things), So that I am not separated from the perception of Immortality (Immortal Essence pervading everywhere). 

But Swami P says this is a very weak and amateur way to interpret the last line. We are praying to none other than Lord Shiva so it has to be much more grand(er) than that - it is not free me from bondage but make these bondages move away from me (it is said in this breed of cucumber quoted in this sloka, it is the creeper that moves away from the ripened cucumber and not that the cucumber drops off when ripened. When I first heard this explanation I was in awe of our Rishis who came up with these mantras and their keen sense of observation) 

Prayer to Lalithambike with the chant of LS is believed to have the same effect of divine blessing (a) a beginner seeker gets to be more qualified  and (b) the qualified seeker takes that giant step inwards


# nama 8 / 1000 - Apr 14

## रागस्वरूप-पाशाढ्या - rāgasvarūpa-pāśāḍhyā

This nama means - Holding the noose that helps pull desires. Here the word used to describe desire is Raga (Desire / Wish or Ichha). 

{Tamil speakers will note the connection of Lord Yama to Pasa கயிறு (Rope) - this is not as the Lord of Death but as the Guru who gave Nachiketha the Brahma Jnanam in Katho Upanishad acknowledging the young boy’s clear sense of discrimination between the Eternal v. Ephemeral} 

There are 3 saktis (Icha, Kriya and Jnana) and this nama refers to Icha Sakti . She will never allow Her devotees to sink or lose their ultimate purpose driven by pointless desires. This weapon she has in her lower left hand and is represented by Asvarudda Devi.

When Arjuna asks Krishna in the Gita as to what really traps a human into committing mistakes, the Lord responds  in Gita 3.37 - काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भव: - kāma eṣha krodha eṣha rajo-guṇa-samudbhavaḥ - The Lord replied – (It is) this desire. (It is) this anger. (It is) born of Rajōguṇa. (It is) insatiable and very sinful. Know this to be the enemy in this life. 

Every scripture pretty much says the same thing - We dont know that we are the Consciouness and somehow delude ourselves to think we are this body/mind. Once that mistake is done it is trouble and more trouble all the way as the sense of incompleteness (apurnatvam) never goes away even after any amount of money or wealth or possessions or relationships. And sense of incompleteness manifests itself in 2 ways - (1) wanting more and more for me & my family - the I,Me & Mine trap & (2) not wanting to share outside the selfish circle.  Specific namas will be used in LS later to define these 2 blunders. 

Adi Shankaracharya in his commentary on the Gita cannot be bothered to explain chap 1 and its gory details plus all of Arjuna’s glycerine theatrics. He simply summarises Arjuna’s problem in 4 words - aham ēṣām and mama ētē. I have a group of people and I claim those people as belonging to me and I claim myself as belonging to them. ahaṅkāra mamakāra saṅga is the root of all troubles, Acharya says.  It is said that the great singer M S Subbalakshmi was so deeply moved by the teachings of Adi Shankaracharya especially on the topic of our real identity and therefore the evil of desires that throughout her life she pretty much shared everything she had, and in her final weeks/months died penniless without  having much to even afford her diabetic medication.  While there may be a temptation to call her a ‘loser’ it would be worthwhile to pause to reflect if she was not the greatest “gainer” and what life lessons we may learn from her. Some of you who know the story of Janaka’s previous birth will appreciate this point better (attaching the link in case you have not heard this gut wrenching story by SPJi - https://youtu.be/UB5Lz3uXo_A) 

Therefore this nama higlights, for the right seeker (that we defined in nama 5), the Divine mother will use this rope and ensure the desires don't detract you from the real objective.  No prizes for guessing that the next nama will talk about another weapon in one of her hands which will address anger.

And straight away in as early as the 2nd verse LS swoops in like a Vulture on our 2 main problems that Lord Krishna identifies in the Gita.  The Divine Mother is not the one to waste time and beat around the bush. I am guessing she could focus better mostly because she did not have to undergo torture and wailing from the likes of Arjuna for one full chapter.  Admin only post groups have a distinct advantage even if they are somewhat Vladimir Putin-ish 🇷🇺 🫡 😀


# nama 9 / 1000 - Apr 17

## क्रोधाकाराङ्कुशोज्ज्वला- krodhākārāṅkuśojjvalā 

Same logic as the previous nama and while nama 8 covered the topic of ‘desire’ this nama covers ‘anger’. 

The nama means - She holds an elephant hook (in her right upper arm) . Krodha means anger/hatred,  akara means knowledge & Ankusham means elephant hook & ujjvala = shining.   She uses this elephant hook to destroy the anger/hatred if developed in her Devotees and gives them right knowledge.  The right lower arm is represented by Sampathri Devi (i am listing these names as they come later in the LS and will be important for us to tie back to this nama).  Dont want to belabour the points mentioned during Nama 8 on the qualified devotee and the grace of the Divine mother. 

Worthwhile to make a point on how anger/hatred even pops up and why Lord Krishna cited it as 1 of 2 evils and why the LS starts with the need to address the exact same 2 topics. Gita sloka 2.62 and 2.63  goes like this listing the 8 steps to total ruin in this body/mind

(1) For a person who is constantly thinking of the sense objects (2) a fondness for them arises (3) From fondness desire is born  (4) From desire comes anger (5) From anger arises delusion (6) delusion results  in the loss of memory - forgets the teachings of the scriptures (7) From the loss of memory (results) the loss of discrimination between right and wrong (8) Because of the loss of discrimination He totally perishes (and continues in this rebirth cycle) 

Important here to analyse why and how anger comes from desires.  

Desires--> fulfilled--> more desires -->become bigger and bigger as there is always the sense of incompleteness--> Outsized Desires-->when Unfulfilled-->anger-->downward spiral starts

For this advanced group did not want to go into a moral science discourse on permitted (dharmic) v. non-permitted desires(adharmic, excessive, hoarding etc) All of you very well understand the difference of what is being referred to here. 

The divine mother with her 'noose' and 'elephant hook' is there to fix the 2 most fundamental issues that trip us up everyday provided we are a qualified seeker . 

I am guessing Sage Vyasa is a bit upset with himself that he did not add a footnote to Gita 2.64 to push everyone chant LS.  In fact in all established Veda Paatashallas (vedic schools), every young student is taught to chant LS and they chant it daily rain or shine just to seek the Divine Mother's blessings to seek to overcome desire and anger apart from of course the other blessings. 

Ishwara Kripa (or grace) truly manifests itself only as Sastram and Guru.  Remember Sage Narada had diplomatic passport to all 3 Lokas and could get darshan of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva daily along with their consorts anytime he chose. But was never fulfilled as he felt there was always something lacking. Only after a penance to Brahmaji and the subsequent tuition he received on Atma Jnanam from Sage Sanathkumara did Narada attain Mukthi (detailed in Chap 7 of Chandogya Upanishad - attaching link to verse below). And Sanathkumara was none other than Lord Karthikey (Skanda) . Even for a dedicated bakth like Narada, who his entire life kept chanting “Narayana Narayana”,  was given a “different” Guru to enable him realise the ultimate non dual truth. This ties in nicely with our earlier conclusion that the form of God is quite irrelevant but what is important is the teaching and shraddha in the scriptures and subsequent saadhana. So remember after all your jaap and prayers to your Ishta devata, someone else appears to give you atma jnanam don’t shoo Him/Her away 😀. More of this in the next nama.

With this we complete verse 2. We will start verse 3 tomorrow.

The rope and elephant hook referred to in nama 8 & 9 . Nama 10 & 11 will talk about the Sugarcane (mind) & flowers (Tanmatras/Jnanendriyas)
