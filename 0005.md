# nama 5/1000 - Apr 11 

देवकार्य-समुद्यता - devakārya-samudyatā

This nama has a very close resemblance to Gita sloka 4.08 (परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् : paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśhāya cha duṣhkṛitām = To protect the righteous & to annihilate the wicked).  This nama of LS translates to "manifested herself for fulfilling the objectives of the devas" .

Even though most of the Puranic stories on the Devi are related to Her slaying some demon or the other, a close observation of this nama will show you the primary purpose of any manifestation/avatara is for the upliftment of the "good folks" and all this war and slaying of the "bad fellows" is only an incidental secondary task - it does appear violent action flicks were more popular than satvic plays even 5000 years back 😊. SPji in his lecture on Gita sloka 4.08 beautifully explains avatara theory and highlights this very point. 

By necessity in her manifestation she also slays the Asuras (Bhandasura and Mahisasura types - as we saw each of these Asuras have a real significance and they are not some crazy wicked chaps meant to be quoted just in some Amar Chitra Katha comics - they are alive and kicking inside us daily).  Though eternal, she is said to be born whenever she manifests herself for the accomplishment of the objectives of the Devas. 

Here ‘Devas’ to be interpreted as the sincere seeker who is Sadhana Chatushtaya Sampanna adhikari (Viveka, Viragya, Shat Sampathi and Mumukshutvam) , who having done selfless karma yoga and achieved ekagrata (concentration) thru sincere devotion to his/her ishta devata is all set to receive this grace.  The Divine mother is very much here within us in this body/mind itself  to vacuum clean away anything (the asuras within) that might detract us from realising Her as the ever present ultimate prize. 

SPji explains this in the audio which I shared last week - it is ONLY with the grace of the divine mother that will we be able to propel ahead overcoming the enormous weight of our past karmas and as devakārya-samudyatā, Lalithambike is there here in us to make that happen ## 

This nama also serves as the bridge shifting the focus from the  Prakasa (unmanifest) to the Vimarsa (manifest) aspect of the Divine Mother and will segue nicely into the next few slokas which describe Her Vimarsa aspect.

This completes verse 1 and tomorrow we will start with verse 2.

Footnotes 

1. A brief note on  the topic of Sadhana Chatushtayam (& what we mean by a qualified person/seeker) -  pls refer to this link .

2. ## I want to clarify as to why I have highlighted "ONLY" in bold . There is no suggestion that one manifested form of the Lord is superior to another or any form is inferior . In LS it is Lalithambike, Bhagavad Gita it is Krishna, Ramayan it is Rama,  Thirupugazh it is Muruga, Shiva Puranam it is Shiva, Devi Mahatmyam it is Durga and so on. Pls feel free  to replace "Lalithambike" with your Ishta Devata as you go thru these posts. The learnings are far more important than the form of the Lord/Goddess - Lord Krishna cant stop saying in the Gita that the ultimate test of progress is when we are able to see everyone as the same reality (Gita 18.20) . The only fervent hope of the scriptures is that we will gradually migrate from seeing God just as Eka Rupa (a single form ) —> Aneka Rupa (it is the same God appearing as different forms) —> Vishwaroopa (it is the same one God appearing as this universe) —> Arupa Ishwara (Nirguna Brahman) and finally —> understanding Tat Tvam Asi to realise God is not different to us in our real nature. The real end is to land at God is never away from us. A very wise friend from Michigan said this to me - “do you know why in the highest point of devotion or surrender we close our eyes, fold our hands and bow our head down towards our chest ?” She continued - “It is because deep down and somehow instinctively we know (but can never express it well in words or is forgotten once the eyes open) that the Real God resides inside of us and is the ever present Consciousness” .
