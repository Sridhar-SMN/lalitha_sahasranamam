When Her śaktīs (army) are getting ready to destroy the army of the demon Bhaṇḍasurā, She was delighted. Bhaṇḍa also means ignorant soul afflicted with duality, sainya (army) also refers to duality (identifying the self as different from the Brahman), and vadha means destruction.  Devi is delighted at the onset of these ideas of non-duality in our thought process. For, when a seeker enjoys even but a small portion of (true) bliss, the veil (of ignorance) is destroyed irreversibly. When duality is removed, it is an indication of the removal of the veil of māyā. The duality can be removed only by internal exploration with the help of mind and birth of knowledge into this very mind thanks to the grace of the Lord/Devi/Universe - expressed as Her delight.  No wonder Lord Krishna in Gita 7.17 calls these Jnanis as his favorite.  Dont want to repeat the old story again that Divine grace manifests itself as Guru and Scriptures.  You know the drill.

## nama 73 - June 9 

## 73. नित्या-पराक्रमाटोप-निरीक्षण-समुत्सुका  - nityā-parākramāṭopa-nirīkṣaṇa-samutsukā

She rejoices at beholding the rising valour of the Nityas. Nityas, the eternal energies of one's efforts to conquer ignorance & the associated rising valour & efforts (Parakramtopa) resulting in continual progress. Once developed the germ of knowledge in our minds cannot be reversed and continues to increase. The Yogavasista says: " All human arts perish by non-use, but the germ of wisdom once risen (in the heart) is never destroyed, but continues to grow."

I could have combined both 72 and 73 into one day but consciously avoided that so you have the time to read this amazing piece from Yoga Vashista and the wonderful story. Pretty much the entire spiritual teaching of the destruction of Bhandasura is contained in this story. 

Pls read the below story from Yoga Vashista - Sage Vashista is explaining how this awakening of the thirst for wisdom has to be nourished - As is evident in this nama and from Gita 10.11, the Divine grace takes both mercy and delight at our efforts to realise our true nature providing us with the necessary tools - the key is to understand the ultimate goal with fullest clarity and putting in maximum effort to extract the grace. The link below has the story towards the bottom half but recommend you read the whole link with the details of the teaching.
