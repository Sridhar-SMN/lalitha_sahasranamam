# Nama 10/1000- Apr 18

## मनोरूपेक्षु-कोदण्डा - manorūpekṣu-kodaṇḍā 

From Nama 8 and 9 it is clear the Divine mother takes care of the 2 main “enemies” and as such now the mind is purer and less messed up. The traditional function of the mind - Sankalpa (how one thinks) and Vikalpa (doubting/debating) - are now nicely streamlined thanks to blessing of the previous 2 namas and when such a mind is squeezed what is left is the sweet juice of sugarcane depicted by the Bow in the hand of the Divine mother.  From sugarcane the sweetest juice can be enjoyed. The same way when Lalithambike has her reign on our minds we do understand the sweetest reality of Saguna and Nirguna nature.  Mano = mind, Ikshu = Sugar cane & Kodanda = Bow. Another interpretation takes this nama as Samashti mind of the manifested aspect of the Divine mother.  This makes a lot of sense as both Mind (Anthakarana) and the next nama on Tanmatras essentially are in their subtle form (sukshma rupa) the Sattva aspect of Maya (Sakthi of Brahman) as per creation theory. For details pls refer Tattva Bodha.

This is the traditional way many books describe this nama and it sounded reasonable but honestly for  me it felt somewhat Bollywoodish. No usage of a prop in any scripture is without an appropriate reason. All this sugarcane juice thingy seemed somewhat suspect to me but then I am no authority so pls read below with a heavy pinch of salt. 

I personally feel the concept of Bow in the Upanishads presents a very different interpretation for this Nama.  Mundaka Upanishad has the archery example and the Bow is representative of Scriptures.  The Upanishad says - Paramatma is the target, Jivatma is the arrow and the Bow is the Sastram/Scripture upon which the Arrow is placed and aimed at the target 🎯.  The learning is that the arrow does not need to travel spatially but realise that in essence Jivatma and Paramatma are one and the same. 

Therefore indicating that with appropriate Shravanam, Mananam & Nidhidyasanam the qualified seeker (represented by the sharpened arrow) will achieve its goal of “reaching” the Paramatma.  And the Divine mother will open doors to the right scripture at the right time (some of us who regularly chant LS or VS or any prayer sincerely can personally vouch for this) and She will also send you the Guru you need (again we can vouch for this) . So my take is this nama is the grace of the divine mother when she “loads our minds on the Bow of Sastram (scripture)” and also gives us the appropriate archer (guru) who will guide us towards our ultimate purpose. 

Even though the earlier sugar cane juice version makes sense, I personally like the Bow = Scripture way of interpreting this and hope you will agree it is not too preposterous or far fetched.  

In my defense, I quote the mantra from Mundaka Upanishad with humble pranams to Swami P for bringing it to life.  An added point to the archery imagery is that the string of the bow needs to be pulled in first before shooting the arrow, which actually represents that with devotion to the Divine Mother our minds become internally focused and stops roaming distracted by the outside bling bling. 

धनुर् गृहीत्वौपनिषदं महास्त्रं
शरं ह्युपासा निशितं सन्धयीत ।
आयम्य तद्भावगतेन चेतसा
लक्ष्यं तदेवाक्षरं सोम्य विद्धि ॥ 

dhanur  gṛhītvaupaniṣadaṃ mahāstraṃ
śaraṃ hyupāsā niśitaṃ sandhayīta .
āyamya tadbhāvagatena cetasā
lakṣyaṃ tadevākṣaraṃ somya viddhi 

Take the Upanishad as the bow , the great weapon and place upon it the arrow sharpened by concerted effort and Then, having drawn it back with a mind directed to the thought of Brahman, strike that mark, O my good friend-that which is the Imperishable.

As we discussed yesterday the grace of the Lord/Divine mother always manifests as the Guru and Sastram (scriptres) 

Not a great cross connection but somewhat even in the Bhagavad Gita every time Arjuna lets slip the Bow his sense of purpose and direction is lost (1.27, 1.49 &   2.09).


# Nama 11/1000 :  Apr 19 

## पञ्चतन्मात्र-सायका : pañcatanmātra-sāyakā 

Pañca means five and tanmātra-s are sound, touch, sight, taste and smell, the subtle modifications of the five basic elements space, air, fire, water and earth & Sayaka = arrows.

The earlier nāma spoke about the bow and this nāma talks about Her arrows. She has five arrows. These five arrows are made of flowers. The five flower arrows represent five subtle elements – Tanmatras (Sabda/Sound, Sparsha/Touch, Rupa/Form, Rasa/Taste, Gandha/Smell) which manifest in their gross form as our Jnanendriyas (don’t want to go into Tattva Bodha theory here and will refer you to that text for details) .

These five flowers or arrows are described differently in various tantra śāstra-s and they are meant to represent the 5 qualities that can set us off path - excitement, madness, confusion, stimulation and destruction.  

Again going back to the Mundaka Upanishad quote yesterday,  the Upanishad requires that the mind be undisturbed and compares it with the need for an arrow to be sharp to hit the target.  phal/फल has its origin to this - बाण के आगे का वह धारदार भाग जिससे आघात किया जाता है (the sharp tip of the arrow that pierces is called _फल/Phal). फल/phal in also means fruit or we can take as fruit of devotion to the Divine mother. 

Thru devotion to the divine mother in this nama, She guides us by “arranging” our arrows in the right way and not letting the 5 qualities (stated above) from blunting the arrow . Thus making sure we get the full fruits/फल for our sincere attempts and as such ensuring we get the full benefit from all the scriptural knowledge that one may be blessed with. 

Ultimately the presence of divine thought in our mind and Jnanendriyas is what allows us to take that required pause before responding v. reacting and it is here the Divine mother plays the crucial role of blessing the sincere seeker by being somewhat like a traffic police ensuring a budding vasana is allowed time to incubate in the “green room” before it is enacted on the stage of life.  SPji is big on this “need to take pause using our free will” to filter Vasanas before they become thoughts, words or actions and here is where the blessing of the divine mother allows us that extra 1-2 seconds. 

This is Her right upper hand and Vārāhī Devi is represented by this hand.

(Thank You Alpana for the timely side note explaining the beautiful significance of फल which has proved so valuable to explain this nama 🙏)


# Nama 12/1000 : Apr 20

## निजारुण-प्रभापूर-मज्जद्ब्रह्माण्ड-मण्डला : nijāruṇa-prabhāpūra-majjadbrahmāṇḍa-maṇḍalā

Her red-rose like complexion radiates the universe with red colour. From this nāma onwards, the gross description of Lalitāmbikā begins. When physical description of a God is made, it is from foot to head and for Goddesses it is from head to foot. For Lalitāmbikā, the description begins from Her head. 

For the next 60 odd namas  it will be very specific describing the form of the Divine mother, her throne, her army, city etc . We will cover 2 namas per day as the comments will be very brief. Only nama 44 and couple more in 60’s we will expand as there are significant points to make. 

You can pick any one of the next 60 odd namas and use it for objectification/focus during you Dhyana/meditation etc 

So next month or so will be easy ride for me. 
——————————-

Footnote 

Even for this nama we can give an advanced interpretation by taking Nija as “own” and Aruna as “light” and equating it to substratum/adhistanam etc especially given that both in the Upanishads and Gita, light is used as proxy for Brahman/Atman . But it is better left as a Saguna description. However do note though that all Saguna descriptions have a a deeper Nirguna interpretation, just like every Puranic story has an underlying Vedantic purpose driving us unsuspectingly but surely towards our finding our real identity. 

I truly believe it is all one giant satvic scam by the Lord/Divine Mother in cahoots with our Rishis neatly disguising and packaging the same stuff to suit our different individual temperaments. 

For some of us Saguna Ishwara Bakthi angle works best, for a few others Puranic stories work nicely and for some “weird” few Vedanta , especially Advaita, works straight away. Divine Mother, as Srimata to all, has to only decide which text book+tuition master (guru) combo She needs to send our way. 😀🙏
