Her waist is to be known only from creeper like hair as described in the previous nāma. The secretive meaning is that ātma is subtle and can be known only by keen observation & application - Shravanam, Mananam & Nidhidhyasanam -SMN. Without adequate SMN if we sit it in meditation we merely shift from being a agitated ajnani to a calm ajnani. 

स्तनभार-दलन्मध्य-पट्टबन्ध-वलित्रया  - stanabhāra-dalanmadhya-paṭṭabandha-valitrayā

The golden belt that She wears supports Her waist as it bends under the heaviness of Her bosoms, resulting in three folds in Her stomach area.

The possible interpretation could be that Her compassion to the universe is vast which is referred to as heaviness here. The three lines in Her hip indicate Her three activities – creation, sustenance and dissolution. Her time for compassion is more than Her other activities. After all She is the Supreme Mother - Srimata (nama 1). 

Do note like in Gita 10.11 the Lord's compassion expresses not as some magical rewriting of Prarabdh but providing means for right knowledge so as to build adequate strength to overcome the effects of Prarabdh (good or bad or mixed). God gives you a Guru, Guru gives you the scriptural knowledge and Scriputures give you back to yourself.
