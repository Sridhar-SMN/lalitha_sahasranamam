In case you have not yet read the Devi Mahatmiyam post sent on May 26th - kindly urge you to read it thoroughly. Starting from this nama is the slaying of the demon Bhadasura - Bhandasura is a puranic character used to represent the demons inside of us and not some wicked fellow who was tormenting the good guys.

Deva + rṣi + gaṇa. Deva means gods and goddesses, rṣi means sage and gaṇa means demigods. She is worshipped by gods, goddesses, sages, demigods and goddesses. Stūyamānātma means worshipping. Vaibhavā means all pervading. Only Brahman or Pramātman is all pervading. Devas and rṣis will not worship anybody below the grade of the Supreme Brahman (BG 7.17). So this indirectly implies Her status of nirguṇa Brahman.

It is also said that sage Nārada approached Lalithanmibke to help slay demon Bhaṇḍāsura who was causing immense trouble to Devas and rṣis. The deeper meaning of this nāma is - demons here mean the ahamkara arising out of ignorance as highlighted in the May 26th Devi Mahatmiyam post. it is so strange that ahamakara which is the first product of ignorance (avidya) so loyally follows every dictate of Avidya. This has to be the most loyal boss-employee relationship (borrowed from Alpana’s notes on Vichara Sagara) . Divine mother is approached by them to absolve them of their Ahamkara as She alone is capable of absolving them. Karmas/Punyam/Papam cycle are committed because of Ahamkara {I am careful not to call Ahamkara as Ego given it sends out the wrong message. Ahamkara simply means falsely identifying with this body/mind - Gita 3.27}

Now let us learn how this fellow Bhandasura got his name 

where did Bhanda come from? Concerning the burning of Manmatha by Lord Shiva’s 3rd eye (which in itself is a story of knowledge burning desires) the story goes that Lord Ganesa seeing the ashes of the god of Love, made from them a beautifully formed man . Lord Brahma on seeing this action, said, "well done, well done " (Bhanda, Bhanda), hence, in the world he is called Bhanda. Bhanda really means desire & attachment.  As Bhandasura sprang from the ashes of the burnt Manmatha - he had the potent mix of the quintessential villian - Manmatha the king of desires&attachment plus  the anger of Shiva minus the knowledge. Say no more - this chap definitely was going to be a back bencher . having caused this nightmare called Bhandasura; Lord Ganesha is called upon later in the LS to solve the mess he created

where did Asura come from?  - Asura = Asu + Ra.  Asu means life (or a deeper meaning is knowledge of our true nature) and  "ra" means  to take away.  So Asura means - he who takes away the knowledge of our real identity from us. 

Ok, now back to the nama which simply means - She is ready with Her army to wage a war against Bhaṇḍasura.  As we saw  Bhandasura = The one who takes away knowledge (life) by causing attachment. Bondage refers to attachments, desires etc. Since lack of knowledge is the cause for duality, it is called bondage. If one has knowledge, he will say I am That (Brahman). However caught in the dual power of Maya - Avarana (veiling of our real nature) & Vikshepa (projecting of this world including this body/mind as real), we are deluded to think we are something that we are not. It is the primal limiting condition which reduces universal consciousness to a jīva or individual soul. This state of mind is called innate because, the mind does not realise the Brahman and as a result gets bonded. Liberation is needed to get out of this bondage. (Gita 3.27 and 7.13) . Liberation is possible only with knowledge. (Gita 4.33) 

(Pls read this along with the first few namas of LS which talk about the 4 instruments in the 4 hands of the divine mother and you will see how all this tied up neatly) 

The secretive meaning of this nāma is – Lalithambike is ready to give us liberation from the cycles of birth and death, provided we have inclination to know about Her (Swami P cannot stop highlighting the importance of self effort and ishwara's grace in this journey - Gita 6.05+ 3.11+ 10.10 —-> 10.11 —> 4.33 —> 4.34 . Ishwara’s grace always manifests as the right guru appearing in front of us). Slokas 6.05, 3.11 and 10.10 signify self effort; 10.11 signifies Ishwara’s grace; 4.33 is the knowledge of 13.03 and 4.34 is how we get that knowledge. 

Bhaṇḍāsura is an embodiment of ignorance and resultant evil acts. She is ready to wage a war against ignorance and its associated acts. Śaktisenā means Her different acts, not just creation but sustenance and dissolution as well.

Footnote - Third Eye above of Lord Shiva or Divya Chakshu of the Gita is not some new eye that pops up on the forehead like we see in Indian movies with loud music and fire coming out of the forehead etc. It is a figurative representation of the “eye of knowledge” that opens inwards to our inner reality when guided by the right knowledge thanks to grace of Guru and Ishwara/Divine Mother. Both in the Gita (chap 11) and in Kandar Anubhuthi (KA 12)  this is temporarily loaned to the seeker to get a glimpse of what it means to be “self realised” and to understand the real meaning of negation of time and space arriving at being able to see the same reality seemingly appear as everything. In Gita chap 11 - all the description of what happens after the “loaning” of the Divya Chakshu is narrated by Arjuna (not by the Lord) and Sage Vyasa had no choice but to use some extravagant poetic canvas to convey how Arjuna saw the world and himself when Time and Space got negated. In fact in KA 12 the poet captures the state, dare I say better than in the Gita, with the words - அம்மா  பொருளொன்றும்  அறிந்திலனே - Ammaa poruL onrum arinthilane = Oh My God - I have no objects that I can cognize = everything is same reality.  Pls refer back to nama 21 & 22 on Apr 27 which explains the crux of Vishwaroopa darshan - seeing everything as the same reality both now and across the time/space paradigm is the real meaning of third eye and the destruction of our Bhandasura

Gita fans would have noticed that Bhandasura is what Lord Krishna describes in sloka 3.37 - the 2 evils - Desire and Anger (which we saw in previous namas) So all our middle names are “Bhandasura” 🤦‍♂️ . My grand mother was right when she said I would grow older and make a name for myself ! Separately it occured to me after I wrote this today that the Kamokarsheet mantra which we saw on Apr 12 is also to conquer desire and anger. Amazing how all the scriptures tie together on the same central theme so neatly and in such poetic symmetry
