## Nama 59 & 60 - May 24

## महापद्माटवी-संस्था - mahāpadmāṭavī-saṃsthā

She dwells in a great forest full of lotus flowers is the gross meaning but more subtly this nāma talks about the crown chakra or sahasrāra, situated above the six chakras of our body. A minute aperture in the centre of sahasrāra is called brahmarandhra or padmāṭavī. The divine energy enters human body through this aperture only. Human contact with higher planes is established through this aperture.  This aperture is connected to all the six cakras. The Siva Sakthi aikyam of Sakthi conjoining  Her consort Śiva is in  sahasrāra. This nāma talks about Her domicile in the middle of a thousand petal lotus or sahasrāra.  With Lotus found in water, this nama is also known to refer to the water tatvam of the pancha boothas.

In Bhagavad Gita Chapter 8 Lord Krishna talks about the requirements for Krama Mukthi and in sloka 8.10 brings out what it means to center the prana at agna cakra (and then hope and pray for divine grace) &  let it out thru sahasrara chakra. Great Yogis are adept at doing this which is why Lord adds a requirement in 8.10 -  योगबलेन - with adequate yogic practice. 

so as per Gita 8.05/8.06 while it is important to remember the Lord's name for Krama Mukthi (not a requirement for Jeevan Mukthi) at point of death, it is only one of the many requirements to be on the direct flight to Brahm Lok. So if you miss provisions of 8.10 and/or the previous slokas and as such are reborn in Matunga or Ang Mo Kio or Chandni Chowk or worse in a Republican state in USA, don't grow up in next birth and try to sue Lord Krishna. He would have already factored in the Yog Brasht clause and hopefully given you a nicer birth (for chanting his name at the time of death) but he is not responsible for you not being in Brahma Lok. He will merely give you another copy of slokas 8.04-8.12 and ask you to read it properly this time as you go around the Sun 😀.

## कदम्बवन-वासिनी - kadambavana-vāsinī

She lives in the middle of kadaṃba trees whose flowers have divine fragrance. Her Cintāmaṇi graha is surrounded by a forest of kadaṃba trees. Nature’s greenery is mentioned here. By such narrations, Vāc Devis describe Her pṛthivī (earth of the pancha bhutas) tattvam. She is also called Mother Earth - Bhumadevi.

Kadamba tree :  There is a major spiritual and puranic significance of Kadamba trees.  It is all over Srimad Bhagavatam, Shiva Puranam, Thirupugazh etc.  Goddess Lakshmi wore the garland made of Kadamba flowers from Lord Vishnu. Pretty much every God/Goddess are known to wear this during their wedding/union (you will remember we started this group on Panguni Uthiram day).

Footnote 

Fans of Madurai and Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple will be thrilled to read this : It is  said that when King Kulasekara Pandiyan was on the lookout for an ideal place to establish the capital city of his kingdom, he stumbled upon a forest of kadamba trees. And that’s exactly where he constructed Madurai with the Meenakshi temple at its heart. The Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam refers to the city as ‘Kadambavanam’ and even today, one can find kadamba trees dotting the Aadi Streets inside the temple complex; a big tree stands right behind the imposing West Tower. It is not without reason that the kadamba tree is revered as the sthala vriksham (tree) of the Madurai temple.

## nama 61 - May 25 

## सुधासागर-मध्यस्था - sudhāsāgara-madhyastha

She resides in the middle of the ocean of nectar. Sudhā means nectar, sāgara means ocean and madhyasthā means centre. Sudhā- sāgara is a place in sahasrāra. Just before sahasrāra, there is a place called soma cakra. When kuṇḍalinī reaches this soma cakra, due to the extreme heat, a liquid flows down through the throat (nāma 106). This liquid is called sudhā as its viscosity and taste resembles nectar. This liquid is also called amrṭavarśinī. Amrṭam also means nectar. She being present in the middle of this soma cakra in the midst of ocean of nectar causes this nectar to flow into all the 72,000 (nāḍi-s) nerves of human body. It is said that, if this nectar flows into our body, it does not cause death to the physical body. However this is possible only during advanced stage of kuṇḍalinī meditation. This is said to be the reason for long life of great sages.

footnote - Amritavarshini ragam in carnatic 

when you have the time do read this link especially the story on Ravana playing this raga & another on the great Muthuswamy Dikshithar and this ragam. 

https://anuradhamahesh.wordpress.com/carnatic-raga-appreciation/2-amritavarshini-the-raga-of-rain/

the ragam amritivarshini is one of the best ragam for centring the wavering mind. To give you a sample here is a classical piece https://youtu.be/y51bibJAdJk.  Try to hear with headphones or where there is less ambient noise. If possible pls invoke your Ishta Devata or Guru in your mind before listening to this talented violinist .. you can see why the divine mother might be flowing thru the nadis once you listen to the raga. Lord Krishna in Gita 3.14 also states the entire life process starts with Rain which is the source of food - here divine mother not only nourishes the annamaya kosha but also the manomaya and vigyanamaya kosha by giving us the rain of right knowledge 

Gita 3.14 

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भव: |
यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञ: कर्मसमुद्भव: || 

From food are born the creatures; the origin of food is from rainfall; rainfall originates from sacrifice; sacrifice has action as its origin

## nama 62  - May 26

## कामाक्षी - kāmākṣī

I am glad this nama came up on a Friday as we need to use this nama 62 to set the stage for nama 64 onwards which is the slaying of Bhandasura - Bhandasura = Bhandam+Asura and the real meaning of is Bhandam is attachment caused by false identification with body/mind  & asura is the evil of attachment associated with this mistaken identification.   In a separate footnote below, I have tried to capture the salient features of the significance of Navrathri, the chanting of Durga Saptashati and what is all this killing by the Devi really mean. It will set a nice parallel as we go thru the rest of LS. Nama 64 onwards is the killing of Bhandasura. 

Kamakshi : She has lovely eyes. Her eyes are full of grace, compassion and mercy for the universe. That is why, Her eyes are so beautiful. She fulfils all the desires of Her devotees by Her looks alone. Normally, our thoughts are reflected through our eyes. Kāmā is the combination of two bīja aksharas - kā + mā. kā means Saraswatī and mā means Lakṣhmī. These two goddesses are said to be the eyes of Lalithambike.  In a later nama more reference will be drawn to Goddess Saraswathi and Goddess Lakshmi. 

## Durga Saptasathi - the real significance-what is all this slaying of demons really means and what was the prayer given at the end of the teaching in Devi Mahatmyam ? 

A brief capture of the significance of some of these stories where the demons are slayed by the divine mother.  Borrowing from PVR Narasimha Rao's several Youtube audios I have put down some brief notes. Credit is entirely due only to Mr. Rao. 

1.  A king called Suratha and a businessman called Samadhi go to a guru named Medha to understand real meaning of life.  Puranic names have deep signficance and here Suratha is Su+Ratha - and from Katho Upanishad the Ratha or Chariot is representation of the body complex and Samadhi - stands for Samyak + Aadhi which represents the focused mind and hence equated to a businessman.  When an able body and a focused mind are unable to find real happiness then the intellect with the help of the Guru (hence Medha) is guiding them. 

2. Madhukaitaba demon is having a grand time given Vishnu is under the influence of Yogamaya and Brahmaji gets worried and runs to Devi for help.  Here again Madhu (honey) and Kaitaba (is keeda or bee or insect). The demon represents how we lead our lives - constantly accumulating possessions like honey bee without ever sitting to enjoy the honey. With the blessing of Devi the Satoguna is awakened inside of us and our ignorance (tamas) is reduced. We have seen the detailed description of the desire-->anger loop in nama 9 earlier on Apr 17. 

3. The  has the side effect of causing/entrenching Kartritvam or Ahamkara.  This aspect is represented by the demon Mahishasura representing the false pride. The story goes that Mahisha steals from the various devatas and Devi conquers him in the end. The signficance of Mahisha stealing the good work of the devas is representative of our Ahamkara "stealing" the divine play thru our body/mind complex. Every word/action/experience is done through us but our Ego / Ahamkara appropriates everything as "i am the doer".  Prayer to the divine mother is knows to kill the Mahishasura inside us fighting the false pride. There is a beautiful side twist to the Mahisha story as he keeps taking newer forms as the Devi slays him - this again is representative of our Kartritva bhavam (I am the great doer) taking newer and newer forms and messing our journey towards the utlimate divinity.  Because our Ahamkara is not fully extinguished (which really means we went to sleep during chap 7 of Gita), we want to feel proud about something or the other - Today we maybe feeling great for being able to quote so many Gita slokas or LS slokas or number of prayers we know. Another day is how we helped a poor person and so on. The idea is with the blessings of the divine mother the Mahisha inside of us is summarily extinguished.

4. There are lots more demons killed but i will end with this as last point.  The 3 demons Shumbha, Nishumba and Rakthabeeja and their killing has a wonderful philosophical signficance.  You would remember that Adi Shankaracharya could not be bothered writing commentary on the 1st chapter of Gita but instead he summarised Arujna's problem in one phrase - Aham Esham, Mama Yete (we saw this in nama 8 on Apr 14). Shumba and Nishumba represent this phrase with Shumba standing of I-ness and Nishumba for My-ness.  Rakthabheeja has an interesting twist - here the story is teaching us how to go even beyond Sattva - and this demon has a unique boon that when he is killed and a drop of blood hits the floor, another Rakthbheeja with the same potency rears his ugly head. What this means is our huge storehouse of Vasanas and Karmas will keep popping up newer and newer versions of I-ness & My-ness and here the form of Devi which destroys the demon is named Kalika (which actually means complete detachment) and Kalika kills Rakthabheeja by licking all the blood drops before they hit the ground symbolically highlighting that the true knowledge in LS and our scriptures will help us summarily overcome the ignorance/confusion on the non-existent ego. 

And finally the prayer that was given to Suratha and Samadhi was nothing less than the spectacular Devi Suktham.  This is the oldest hymn from the Vedas and probably the first known "Girl Power" moment. Sage Vagambrini, the young girl, was all of 16 years old when she with the power of her karmic momentum realised the truth about her real nature and chanted the Suktham which is now called Devi Suktham - she sees all reality as one and in her true nature claims She is everything.  Not from the point of view of her body/mind but as the Atman.  Suratha and Samadhi chanted Devi Suktham for 3 years continuously (in addition to developing adequate Sadhana Chatustayam) and were blessed with the realisation of the non-dual truth at the end of their penance/tapas. 


## nama 63  - May 29

## कामदायिनी - kāmadāyinī

She fulfils whatever is desired. Before we get carried away or confused, which i dont think is a risk with this group, we can be sure this nama refers to the deserving for their legitamate needs (Yogakshemam Vahamyaham of Gita 9.22 for the Nishkama bakth).  There are several interpretations for this nāma. Kāma means Kāmeśvara, a form of Śiva. Dāyini means giver. It has been discussed earlier that Śaktī alone leads to Śiva and there is no direct access to Him. She takes Her devotees to Śiva (remember the Divine mother is called Siva in an earlier nama), the supreme prakāśa form, the nirguṇa Brahman . Here taking the devotee is to be equated not to indicate any physical or mental travel but the right knowledge (jnanam & vigyanam) being imparted to the seeker. She is like a veil around Śiva and unless this veil is removed, Śiva cannot be realized. This veil can be removed only at Her will (as is confirmed by Lord Krishna in Gita 10.11) . In a later nama in verse 140 the Goddess will be called Siva Jnana Pradhayini but that is the context of the revelation that she is none other than Lord Dakshinamurthy.  We will see that when we cross that bridge. 

With this, the description of Her physical or gross form ends. Namas 64 to 84 narrate the slaying of demon Bhandāsura.

——-

Footnote : Any reference to Kamadayini has to be equated to Gita 9.22 and understood in the proper context.  Here is quoting the very precise explanation by Adi Shankaracharya for the term योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् - Yogakshemam Vahamyaham in Gita 9.22 - the same import has to be used for this nama 63

9.22 On the other hand, ye janah, those persons, who are desireless and fully illumined; who ananyah, becoming non-different (from Me), having realized the supreme Deity, Narayana, as their own Self; and cintayantah, becoming meditative; ['Having known that I, Vasudeva, am the Self of all, and there is nothing else besides Me'.] paryu-pasate mam, worship Me everywhere; ['They see Me the one, all-pervading, infinite Reality.'] tesam, for them; who have realized the supreme Truth, nitya-abhiyuktanam, who are ever attached (to Me); aham, I; vahami, arrange for; both yoga-kesamam, securing what they lack and preserving what they have. Yoga means making available what one does not have, and ksema means the protection of what one has got. Since 'but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) My opinion' and 'he too is dear to Me' (7.17,18), therefore they have become My own Self as also dear. 

Does not the Lord surely arrange for securing what they lack and protecting what they have even in the case of other devotees? This is true. He does arrange for it. But the difference lies in this: Others who are devotees (not the Nishkama Jnani) make their own efforts as well for their own sake, to arrange for securing what they lack and protecting what they have. On the contrary, those who have realized non-duality do not make any effort to arrange for themselves the acquisition of what they do not have and the preservation of what they have. Indeed, they desire nothing for themselves, in life or in death. They have taken refuge only in the Lord. Therefore the Lord Himself arranges to procure what they do not have and protect what they have got. कामदायिनी - kāmadāyinī has to be understood in this context. 

## Expressing the sequence in Gita Slokas : 2.47 —> 6.05 —> 7.14 —> 9.22 —> 10.11 —> 2.16 —> 13.03 (क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां विद्धि = Tat Tvam Asi) --> 18.66 —> 5.8 & 5.9 --> 3.17 --> Jeevan Mukthi here and now

(given half a chance i will petition to Lord Krishna to make sloka 3.17 the grand finale of the Bhagavad Gita)
