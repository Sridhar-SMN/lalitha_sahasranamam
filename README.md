# LS: Lalitha Sahasranamam

We will start on the auspicious Panguni Uthiram Day - Apr 5

Posts will be on weekdays only and for now have kept it as admin only to ensure it is limited traffic and light touch for all.

## As the divine mother represents Siva Sakthi Aikya svaroopam we pray to her on this day to guide us and fill our minds with true knowledge as we embark on the LS learning journey 🙏🙇‍♂️

#### quoting from Kandar Anubhuthi # 17 and fully cognisant that everything is revelaed by divine grace

#### யாமோதிய  கல்வியும்  எம்மறிவும், தாமேபெற  வேலவர்  தந்ததனால்
#### பூமேல்  மயல்போய்  அறமெய்ப்  புணர்வீர்,நாமேல்  நடவீர்  நடவீர்  இனியே

#### The learning we had and our knowledge were bestowed on us by Lord Velayudha Himself. Therefore, henceforth cast aside (or overcome) the delusion on the world, be firmly united with Reality, and with the tongue ever sing His glories

### offering all this at the lotus feet of my Guru-Swami Paramarthanandaji, I seek the blessings of the Divine mother & Lord Subrahmanya and venture into this project.

Namaskarams Dear All, 

pleasure and a blessing to be part of this learning & sharing group and also it gives me great joy to welcome so many dear friends and family. 

The logistics are quite simple.  We will see the brief explanation of one nama of LS each day (Asia weekdays only).  I am conscious this is a very advanced group of seekers Jnana Nishtas, and as such will try not to go into elaborate explanations or vedantic concepts (especially because some PhD jamabavans are lurking here) but  where relevant will try my best to give cross references to the Gita, Upanishads & Kandar Anubhuthi (all posts will be in English only and if any Tamil/Sanskrit references will provide links for the relevant meanings in English) 

Today as a teaser we will start with 1 sentence from one of the invocation slokas to LS and on 5th April (the auspicious Panguni Uthiram day) start with the first nama of Lalitha Sahasranamam - fondly abbreviated to LS. 

I will also be including the chanting of the verses by Challekere Brothers and will do so every time we start to explore a new verse in the main LS. Typically in a verse there will be between 3-6 namas and we will cover one nama per day and in total there are 1000 namas.  

To keep it WhatsApp light for all have kept it as posting by admin only. 

Praying to the divine mother to be with us in this journey and guide us towards the uncovering of the ultimate truth.

one of the invocation slokas chanted before LS is quoted below.

अरुणां करुणातरङ्गिताक्षीं
धृतपाशाङ्कुशपुष्पबाणचापाम् ।
अणिमादिभिरावृतां मयुखैः
अहमित्येव विभावये भवानीम्॥

aruṇāṃ karuṇā taraṅgitākṣīṃ
dhṛta pāśāṅkuśa puṣpa bāṇacāpām .
aṇimādibhi rāvṛtāṃ mayūkhaihi-
ahamityeva vibhāvaye bhavānīm

I meditate on the great Empress. She is red in color, and her eyes are full of compassion, and holds the noose, the goad, the bow and the flowery arrow in Her hands. She is surrounded on all sides by powers such as aNimA for rays and She is the Self within me 

Normally the sentence in bold is translated as what i have quoted above in bold. But then we are disciples of Swami P and he always adds that extra gear.  He says this line has to be interpreted not just as "She is the Self within me" but also as "I am none other than Bhavani" - here Bhavani is in reference to Para Prakriti / Brahman and not just the form of the Goddess. Invoking Atma Svarupam is a "must do" from Swami P's perspective to ensure the mind and intellect are perfectly aligned to the real goal like what Lord Krishna says in Gita 3.30 - do Karma and Bakthi but always don’t forget who You really are. 

Swami P is very cute - he says how long are you going to keep saying Brahma Sathyam, Jagath Mithya & Jivo Brahmaiva na param ? When are going to collapse these 3 parts into 2 parts and say Aham Sathyam, Jagath Mithya  ?

May the divine mother bless all of you and your families on this auspicious Panguni Uthiram day .
