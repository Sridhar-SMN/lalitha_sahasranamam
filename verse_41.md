### 112. भवानी - Bhavani - Aug 29

Strangely and interestingly the word "Bhava" means 3 things - Mahadeva, Samsara, and Manmatha; and ana (which become ani and hence Bhavani) means "to give life". 

She, the wife of Siva gives life to all or as Srī Mata (nama 1 - Apr 5) . Since She gave back life to Manmatha (Manmatha is also known as Bhava and we covered the significance of giving life back to Manmatha in nama 84 on Aug 4) she is addressed as Bhavānī. Siva is known as Bhava because the universe was created from Him (bhava also means produced from) and being sustained & dissolved by Him.

A little bit of Sanskrit grammar to bring out the beauty of this nama : The word Bhavani is used in the above verse is seemingly intended by the devotee as an address to the Divine Mother in the vocative case (the vocative case is a grammatical case which is used for a noun that identifies a person), but actually here it is intended as an action (verb) in the first person and an usage of the imperative mood (a verb form used to make a demand/request, issue a warning, or give advice or instructions) and here in this nama it needs to be interpreted as "let me become" 

Lord Krishna of course is jumping with joy to learn we have understood the nama as a "verb" and not a "noun" . In the whole Gita he keeps shouting from the roof top pleading with us to reach the "let me become You - understand our nature and His nature are exactly one and the same" and not waste scratching his legs till they are sore and start to bleed. Almost to make the point emphatically and conclusively in the Gita he says in sloka 7.17 that the baktha who knows "Me as him" (jnani baktha) is "my dearest". Of course this has left the other 3 catergories feeling like the wind has been taken out of their sails and so he comforts them by saying they are also very good bakthas but this "Let me be you" chap is indeed and truly special. 

If you remember we started this whole LS series with this post before Apr 5 and I quote below the invocation sloka that we chant before commencing chanting of the LS - this invocation sloka addresses the Divine Mother as Bhavani in the same imperative mood as intended in this nama. 

अरुणां करुणातरङ्गिताक्षीं धृतपाशाङ्कुशपुष्पबाणचापाम् । अणिमादिभिरावृतां मयुखैः अहमित्येव विभावये भवानीम्॥

I meditate on the great Empress. She is red in color, and her eyes are full of compassion, and holds the noose, the goad, the bow and the flowery arrow in Her hands. She is surrounded on all sides by powers such as aNimA for rays and She is the Self within me

Normally the 4th part of the slokas is translated as what i have quoted above in bold. But then we are disciples of Swami P and he always adds that extra gear. He says this line has to be interpreted not just as "She is the Self within me" but also as "I am none other than Bhavani" - here Bhavani is in reference to Para Prakriti / Brahman and not just the form of the Goddess. Invoking Atma Svarupam is a "must do" from Swami P's perspective to ensure the mind and intellect are perfectly aligned to the real goal like what Lord Krishna says in Gita sloka 7.17.

Swami P is very cute - he says how long are you going to keep saying Brahma Sathyam, Jagath Mithya & Jivo Brahmaiva na param ? When are going to collapse these 3 parts into 2 parts and say Aham Sathyam, Jagath Mithya ???

## 113. भावनागम्या - Bhavanagamya - Aug 30 & 31 

(I normally remove the Youtube banner highlights but this is so vital that I included it make sure everyone knows its importance)

Normally this nama gets translated into Bhavana (thru the mind) + Gamya (attained) - "She is to be realized through the mind" or "She is to be attained by meditation". Well that is before we had the opportunity to listen to Swami Sarvapriyanandaji's Q&A - This Q&A was my baptism by fire (thanks to Alpana pointing me in the direction) and remember it was one of the first Q&A we heard where the whole concept of Vritti Vyapti, Phala Vyapti and the role of mind in Self/God realisation became crystal clear. I will not try to rob you from that amazing experience of listening to the Q&A but will give a brief intro before you listen to it to help set the context.

The nama actually splits 2 ways

Bhavana + Gamya = Realised/attained thru the Mind
Bhavana (short a) + Agamya = Cannot be realised thru the Mind

And both these statements are made by the Upanishads. So which is right ? Answer - both are right and hence this LS nama splits 2 ways - Swami SPji beautifully explains this in this Q&A.

https://youtu.be/Bf45_kW2yI4?si=7o_-5QL9qkLGuHyj - Role of the Mind in Self/God Realisation

I am thrilled the Divine Mother blessed us to connect this nama with SPji's video. Her ways of blessing are truly unique and astounding. If however you are somewhat suicidal and insist on reading a totally incomprehensible version of the same 35-40 minute Q&A then here is Swami P's explanation of the same in a nutshell. This is an explanation of one word that appears in sloka 10.07 of the Gita which later in 10.11 Lord clarifies that out of compassion he lights the lamp of knowledge in the mind of the sincere seeker.

एतां विभूतिं योगं च मम यो वेत्ति तत्त्वत: | सोऽविकम्पेन योगेन युज्यते नात्र संशय: || 
etāṁ vibhūtiṁ yogaṁ cha mama yo vetti tattvataḥ; so ’vikampena yogena yujyate nātra sanśhayaḥ 
meaning : One who knows truly this majesty and yoga of Mine (manifestation of My Being), he becomes imbued with unwavering Yoga. There is no doubt about this.

And Swami P explains the same thing you will hear in SPji's video by expanding on the word सोऽविकम्पेन = sovikampena (which breaks down as sah + avikalpena = the unwavering) and says

"So Bhagavān is located in akhaṇḍākāra vr̥ttiḥ means what? The vr̥tti serves as a reflecting medium, just as mind is a reflecting medium called RM, vr̥itti is also a reflecting medium called RM. And in the vr̥itti, Bhagavān is original-Consciousness, Bhagavān is called bimba-caitanyam, the bimba-caitanyam will be reflected in vr̥itti which is called pratibimba-caitanyam. So bimba-caitanya- Bhagavān will get reflected in the akhaṇḍākāra vr̥itti and that pratibimba-caitanyam is formed that is indicated by ātma-bhāvasthaḥ, finally Bhagavān is in the form of reflected Consciousness. And when vr̥tti is associated with reflected-Consciousness it becomes the lamp of knowledge. When the vr̥itti is associated with pratibimba- caitanyam it will become jñānam because vr̥itti by itself is jaḍam. Only when the reflection is formed vr̥itti plus pratibimba becomes jñānam, jñānam will destroy ajñānam"

I purposely included the most complicated summary by Swami P on this topic so as to force you to listen to the SPji video instead.

## 114. भवारण्य-कुठारिका - Bhavaranya kutarika - Sep 1

This is a simple nama which explains the fruits of the knowledge achieved from the previous nama and the unique blessing of the divine mother

She axes the forest of saṃsāra. Saṃsāra refers to transmigratory existence, which arises because of indulgence in worldly activities such as desire, attachment, love and affection causing bondage. Saṃsāra is compared to forest. Forest consists of many trees. If one wants to clean a forest he needs to axe each and every tree in the forest. It is not just enough to axe the trees. He has to remove the roots too; as otherwise, trees will grow from the roots again. Unless every aspect of saṃsāra is removed at the root level, the bondage is bound to rear its ugly head again causing transmigration.

Lord Krishna says this in so many beautiful ways in the Gita and one of my favorites is Gita sloka 4.16 

प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् - I will now tell you that by which you will be relieved of everything inauspicious. I am simply borrowing the the words and fans of Gita will be quick to point out that the context of this usage is quite different to this topic.  I am just borrowing the words for their poetic beauty and the confidence with which the Lord assures us that everything will be well - or as they sing in the 3 idiots movie - ALL IZZ WELL 

Wishing all a blessed weekend !

## 115. भद्रप्रिया - Bhadrapriya - Sep 4

She likes the act of benefaction. She is keen to shower Her blessings on Her devotees. Devotees are those who try to attain Her by any of the means discussed earlier namas. The act of benefaction is done by Her sacred feet (Actually it the nail as we saw in Nama 80 on July 31)

This is best brought out in the famous verse from the Gita - 9.22 

अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते | तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् || 
ananyāśh chintayanto māṁ ye janāḥ paryupāsate; teṣhāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham

This is both a very popular sloka and therefore by extension also the most misterpreted as it is read/explained without proper context and not entirely realising that the Lord is giving this assurance to Nishkama (selfless) Jigyasu baktha who has dedicated his life's purpose in the pursuit of realising the ultimate truth in God/Brahman.  Briefly explaning the meaning - Indeed, they desire nothing for themselves, in life or in death. They have taken refuge only in the Lord. Therefore the Lord Himself arranges to procure what they do not have (yogam) and protect what they have got (shemam). Of course Shankaracharya has a super strict interpretation of this Gita sloka but for now we will stick with the less stringent version. As much as Lord Krishna provides this assurance in 9.22 he does take a big dettol soap and wash his hands in slokas 9.08 (where He states he is merely projecting the world based on principles of karma theory) and in  9.09 & 9.10 (where He states he is merely like the electricity in a room and remains unconcerned as to what the same is used for without any kartritva abhimana - sense of doership) . Essentially the ball is thrown back firmly in our court and for Gita fans the biggest dettol soap washing hands off sloka is 6.05 where the Lord unequivocally states you sink, float or swim based entirely on your own choices. A side note for Gita learners - Pls always read 6.05 and 3.34 as pair slokas for getting the full meaning of what is intended by the Lord. 

It is also my duty to point out an important albeit somewhat disturbing point in this context. SPji in this video explains the deeper aspects of  "benevolent god" theory  -  very deep and a serious eye opener . I would also like to caution and repeat that it is also somewhat disturbing and can shake the unprepared.  The concluding answer where SPji quotes Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (who was deeply rooted in the bakthi marg) is so profound and the way SPji brings it all together is just brilliant. All of us in this group are blessed with decent socio-economic settings but we know for a fact that is not the case with the majority in the world. So SPji asks and answers the question - "why if God Exists, there is this much suffering" ?

## 116. भद्रमूर्तिर् - Bhadramurtir - Sep 5

I am keeping this light so that you have the time to focus on nama 113 and nama 115 which are crucial. 

The nama says - She is an embodiment of auspiciousness. This is because she is also addressed as Śrī Śiva (nāma 53 we saw on May 18) which means auspiciousness. Brahman alone is auspicious. Therefore, She is addressed here as the Brahman. Viṣṇu Sahasranāma also says in reference to the higher nature of Vishnu - maṅgalānām ca maṅgalaṃ meaning the most auspicious. 

Her very form and formless representation is auspicious. In fact in the Bhagavad Gita sloka 13.02 (which is the blockbuster Mahavakyam sloka of the Gita)  one of the reasons used by Adi Shankaracharya to establish that Ignorance/Avidya of our own true nature cannot be located in the Atman/Brahman is by showing Ignorance is a "dosha" (defect) and anything with defect is subject to modification and as such cannot be located in Atman/Brahman which is Nirvikara (unchanging). He uses this logic to prove that ignorance, as an attribute, which is the cause of samsara can only be located in  the Mind and as such the Jivatma (seemingly enclosed Consciousness) is blemishless, also is the exact same as Paramtma and most crucially using this logic shutting down an opponent who erroneously claims  the ignorance lies with the Jivatma and even more shockingly falsely  by extension claims  Tat Tvam Asi is an incorrect teaching.

## 117. भक्त-सौभाग्यदायिनी - Bhakta sowbhagyadayini - Sep 6

I am keeping this realtively light so that you have the time to focus on nama 113 and nama 115 which are crucial.

This para is a cut/paste : This nama gets translated as - She confers prosperity on Her devotees. There is a reference to saubhāgya aṣṭagam (eight things that gives prosperity) in Agni Purāṇa. They are sugarcane, peepul tree, sprouted jīra seeds, coriander, cow’s milk (and its modifications curd, butter and ghee), everything that are yellow in colour, flowers and salt. All these indicate auspiciousness and prosperity. Young Nachiketa must be rolling his eyes in dismay if we stop explaining this nama just with this material blessing. As students of the LS, Gita and Upanishads we are expected to go from seeking the limited to seeking the unlimited within. 

The real "Sowbhagyam" (prosperity) and the deeper meaning of this nama is when the Divine Mother comes in the form of a  Guru and gives us Atma Jnanam.  Saint Arunagirinathar captures this beautifully in his crest jewel - the Kandar Anubhuthi (The Realisation delivered by Lord Skandha) and the concluding line of the 51 verses of that epic composition is 

### குருவாய்  வருவாய்  அருள்வாய்  குகனே (Guruvaai varuvaai arulvaai guhane) = O Lord Guha, Who comes as the Guru and bestows thy grace !
(and we saw the meaning of the word "guha" on Aug 16 along with the footnote to nama 96-98 in verse 37 and the related sloka from the Mundaka Upanishad)

Lord Krishna also repeats the role & importance of a well read and self realised Guru in the Gita sloka 4.34 who will help reveal this Guhan to us.

तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया | उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिन: || 
Learn the Truth by approaching a Guru (srothriya & brahma nishta). Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Guru can impart knowledge unto you because he has subjective experience of the Truth. SPji said it beautifully during his SG trip recently - when asked a question does your answer come from more words or does it come from silence (subjective experience) ? These "real" gurus have this amazing ability to reveal the truth. 

In all honesty it is complete waste of time with Grihastha fake 'gurus' like me. It is ok for one round of learning the basics but sooner or later one has to seek a real guru.  I see many in SG and India bouncing around in Grihastha circles listening to sincere but half baked versions and strangely refusing to move out of the trap of comfort with people we know. Sooner or later one has to seek a real guru or for sincere effort and intent a real guru will seek you. Not suggesting that if you are yet to find a real guru your sadhana is incomplete or flawed but the point I am trying to get across is non-gurukulam settings (real or virtual) are sub-optimal.
