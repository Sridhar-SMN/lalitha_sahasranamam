### 112. भवानी - Bhavani - Aug 29

Strangely and interestingly the word "Bhava" means 3 things - Mahadeva, Samsara, and Manmatha; and ana (which become ani and hence Bhavani) means "to give life". 

She, the wife of Siva gives life to all or as Srī Mata (nama 1 - Apr 5) . Since She gave back life to Manmatha (Manmatha is also known as Bhava and we covered the significance of giving life back to Manmatha in nama 84 on Aug 4) she is addressed as Bhavānī. Siva is known as Bhava because the universe was created from Him (bhava also means produced from) and being sustained & dissolved by Him.

A little bit of Sanskrit grammar to bring out the beauty of this nama : The word Bhavani is used in the above verse is seemingly intended by the devotee as an address to the Divine Mother in the vocative case (the vocative case is a grammatical case which is used for a noun that identifies a person), but actually here it is intended as an action (verb) in the first person and an usage of the imperative mood (a verb form used to make a demand/request, issue a warning, or give advice or instructions) and here in this nama it needs to be interpreted as "let me become" 

Lord Krishna of course is jumping with joy to learn we have understood the nama as a "verb" and not a "noun" . In the whole Gita he keeps shouting from the roof top pleading with us to reach the "let me become You - understand our nature and His nature are exactly one and the same" and not waste scratching his legs till they are sore and start to bleed. Almost to make the point emphatically and conclusively in the Gita he says in sloka 7.17 that the baktha who knows "Me as him" (jnani baktha) is "my dearest". Of course this has left the other 3 catergories feeling like the wind has been taken out of their sails and so he comforts them by saying they are also very good bakthas but this "Let me be you" chap is indeed and truly special. 

If you remember we started this whole LS series with this post before Apr 5 and I quote below the invocation sloka that we chant before commencing chanting of the LS - this invocation sloka addresses the Divine Mother as Bhavani in the same imperative mood as intended in this nama. 

अरुणां करुणातरङ्गिताक्षीं धृतपाशाङ्कुशपुष्पबाणचापाम् । अणिमादिभिरावृतां मयुखैः अहमित्येव विभावये भवानीम्॥

I meditate on the great Empress. She is red in color, and her eyes are full of compassion, and holds the noose, the goad, the bow and the flowery arrow in Her hands. She is surrounded on all sides by powers such as aNimA for rays and She is the Self within me

Normally the 4th part of the slokas is translated as what i have quoted above in bold. But then we are disciples of Swami P and he always adds that extra gear. He says this line has to be interpreted not just as "She is the Self within me" but also as "I am none other than Bhavani" - here Bhavani is in reference to Para Prakriti / Brahman and not just the form of the Goddess. Invoking Atma Svarupam is a "must do" from Swami P's perspective to ensure the mind and intellect are perfectly aligned to the real goal like what Lord Krishna says in Gita sloka 7.17.

Swami P is very cute - he says how long are you going to keep saying Brahma Sathyam, Jagath Mithya & Jivo Brahmaiva na param ? When are going to collapse these 3 parts into 2 parts and say Aham Sathyam, Jagath Mithya ???

## 113. भावनागम्या  -  Bhavanagamya - Aug 30 

Normally this gets translated into Bhavana (thru the mind) + Gamya (attained) - "She is to be realized through the mind" or "She is to be attained by meditation".  Well that is before we had the opportunity to listen to Swami Sarvapriyanandaji's Q&A -  This Q&A was my baptism by fire (thanks to Alpana pointing me in the direction) and remember it is one of the first Q&A we heard where the whole concept of Vritti Vyapti, Phala Vyapti and the role of mind in Self/God realisation became crystal clear.  I will not try to rob you from that amazing experience of listening to the Q&A but will give a brief intro before you listen to it to help set the context. 

The nama actually splits 2 ways 

1. Bhavana + Gamya = Realised/attained thru the Mind
2. Bhavana (short a) + Agamya = Cannot be realised thru the Mind 

And both these statements are made by the Upanishads. So which is right ?  Swami SPji beautifully explains this in this Q&A.  

*https://youtu.be/Bf45_kW2yI4?si=7o_-5QL9qkLGuHyj - Role of the Mind in Self/God Realisation* 

- I am thrilled the Divine Mother blessed us to connect this nama with SPji's video.  Her ways of blessing are truly unique and astounding. 

If however you are somewhat suicidal and insist on reading a totally incomprehensible version of the same 35-40 minute Q&A then here is Swami P's explanation of the same in a nutshell.  This is explanation of one word that appears in sloka 10.07 of the Gita which later in 10.11 Lord clairfies that out of compassion he lights the lamp of knowledge in the mind of the sincere seeker.

एतां विभूतिं योगं च मम यो वेत्ति तत्त्वत: | सोऽविकम्पेन योगेन युज्यते नात्र संशय: ||
etāṁ vibhūtiṁ yogaṁ cha mama yo vetti tattvataḥ; so ’vikampena yogena yujyate nātra sanśhayaḥ
meaning : One who knows truly this majesty and yoga of Mine (manifestation of My Being), he becomes imbued with unwavering Yoga. There is no doubt about this.

And Swami P explains the same thing you will hear in SPji's video by expanding on the word सोऽविकम्पेन = sovikampena (which breaks down as sah + avikalpena = the unwavering) and Swami P says 

"So Bhagavān is located in akhaṇḍākāra vr̥ttiḥ means what? The vr̥tti serves as a reflecting medium, just as mind is a reflecting medium called RM, vr̥itti is also a reflecting medium called RM. And in the vr̥itti, Bhagavān is original-Consciousness, Bhagavān is called bimba-caitanyam, the bimba-caitanyam will be reflected in vr̥itti which is called pratibimba-caitanyam. So bimba-caitanya- Bhagavān will get reflected in the akhaṇḍākāra vr̥itti and that pratibimba-caitanyam is formed that is indicated by ātma-bhāvasthaḥ, finally Bhagavān is in the form of reflected Consciousness. And when vr̥tti is associated with reflected-Consciousness it becomes the lamp of knowledge. When the vr̥itti is associated with pratibimba- caitanyam it will become jñānam because vr̥itti by itself is jaḍam. Only when the reflection is formed vr̥itti plus pratibimba becomes jñānam, jñānam will destroy ajñānam"

I purposely included the most complicated summary by Swami P on this topic so as to force you to listen to the SPji video instead.
