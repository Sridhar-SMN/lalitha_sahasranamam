## 92. कुलाङ्गना - kulāṅganā - Aug 14 

Kulänganä = belonging to Kula, the chaste family. She belongs to such a family. The meaning is that the respectablo woman is well protected, so, she also is protected (kept in secret) by the veil of avidya. Lord Krishna goes at length to praise "para vidya" (knowledge of Nirguna Brahman) in the Gita and to the extent that he calls those of us as "fools" for not recognising his higher nature in sloka 9.11 (true 9/11 of the Gita).  In the first 3 slokas of the 9th chapter of the Gita, Lord Krishna glorifies the the higher nature of God and the importance of understanding that. Will cover this in detail in the Niruguna descriptions coming up from sloka 46 onwards. 

## 93. कुलान्तस्था - kulāntasthā - Aug 14 

Kulā also means scriptures. She resides in the midst of the scriptures - as we saw earlier in nama 85-87 that the Divine mother is the Knower, Knowledge & Known. I was tempted to write a lengthy note on what it means to have Sraddha in the scriptures but then there is a reason we are blessed with Swami P.  Pls read this transcribed note on the true meaning of Sraddha and its role in our spiritual journey.  This will help you appreciate this nama much much better and I am willing to bet truly help you see the value of our  scriptures.

## 94. कौलिनी - kaulinī - Aug 15

Yesterday we saw the scriptual meaning of Kula/Kaula.  Today we shall see the tantric side. Full disclosure - this is a cut/paste

She is the core of kaula worship. Kaula worship is a tantric worship under śākta method (methods of worshipping Śaktī is called śākta worship). Since She is the centre of this worship She is called kaulīnī. As She is worshiped everywhere (omnipresence), She is called as kaulīnī (as per triad – worshipper, worshipped and worship). Tantra śāstra define Śaktī as kulā and Śiva as akula. The union of Śiva and Śaktī is called as kaula and She is called kuṇḍalinī. This union takes place in sahasrāra. There is a reference in some tantra texts to one more thousand petal lotus, just below the thousand petal lotus, is the sahasrāra. In the centre of the second sahasrāra, Kula Devi is worshiped and in the petals kula Śaktīs are worshiped. Kaulīni also means this kula Devi, the goddess of one’s lineage. One of the Vāc-Devi-s, the authors of this Sahasranāma is known as Kaulīnī. The external worship of cakras, possibly meaning that Śrī Cakra is also called kaulīnī.

## 95. कुलयोगिनी - kulayoginī - Aug 15

Kaulā means mental worship. Here it means offering mental worship to Her in the six cakras. Mental worship can be performed only through yoga. Kula means mūlādhārā cakra and akula means sahasrāra. The link between these can be established only by yogic methods. That is why she is called as Kulayoginī.  

I cant remember in which lecture of Swami P where he states the gradation of the value and effect of prayers (selfless) - said aloud has definitely benefits but even better is saying it softly and quietly with minimal sound but the best is saying it mentally which has the highest effect/benefit. all this assuming the prayers are selfless.  In chap 9 of Gita explaning selfish prayers Adi Shankaracharya says any prayer which is not selfless is an insult to God. 

## 96. अकुला - akulā - Aug 16

The divine mother in her higher nature is Akula - does not belong to any clan.  Again we will see this in greater detail in the Nirguna Brahman description from sloka 46

## 97. समयान्तस्था - samayāntasthā - Aug 16

Samaya is commonly (lit. traditional custom) explained as offering worship, etc., to a cakra in the ether of the heart. That (worship) is unanimously decided by all the yogins as the supreme, hence it is called Samaya. Samaya also means the five books of Vasistha, Suka, Sanaka, Sanandana, and Sanatkumära, because they describe this internal worship. In the Mahanarayana Upanishad there is a beautiful section called Dahara Vidya - contemplation and prayer to the Atman in the Dahara Akasha or the "empty space" inside the Mind where the Atman is obtained.  I am attaching the recording of just that portion of the Upanishad as chanted by Challakere Brothers. It is one of my absolute favorite parts of the Vedas/Upanishads to chant and I am currently learning to chant this section. 

## 98. समयाचार-तत्परा - samayācāra-tatparā - Aug 16

Worshipping Lalithambike in the cakras of kuṇḍalinī, beginning from mūlādhāra cakra is called samayācāra which is covered in the next 2 slokas. The next 2 slokas coming up are probably the most valuable from the standpoint of checking to see where we are in the spiritul journey and is depicted in the temples in so many different ways.  We will pick the depiction of the intertwining snakes and try to understand the next 2 slokas.
