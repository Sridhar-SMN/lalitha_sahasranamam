## Verse 39 - namas 103-104-Aug 21

### 103. आज्ञा-चक्रान्तरालस्था - Aagyna-chakrantaralasdha

I am sure you managed to read up on Vishwamitra story (if not this link will do the trick mostly and the blogger has a nice causal style and also adds some masala to the story - https://sfipodcast.com/episode-15-rishi-vs-rishi-un-civil-war/). 

She resides in ājñā cakra which is also known as third eye and removes our incorrect vision of the world.  I cant tell you if this ia freak coincidence or divine play but just yesterday, I was listening to Swami P explain Jnana Chakshu that Lord Krishna gives to Arjuna in Chap 11 of the Gita and the whole discussion was how to overcome Aham & Mama and convert the Vishwa darshan to Vishwaroopa darshan.

### 104. रुद्रग्रन्थि-विभेदिनी - rudra-grandhi vibhedini

The Divine Mother residing in the Ajna Chakra destroys the knot of envy. I was actually going to leave it here but after listening to Swami P yesterday, I decided I will paraphrase some portions of his commentary on Chap 11 from Shankara Bashyam to explain this better. Slokas 11.37 onwards to 11.55 of the Gita are summarised below. 

Aham and Mama converts Ishwara Srishti into Jiva Srishti and then the raga (like) and dwesha (dislike) demons are unleashed . Dilution of Aham and Mama converts Jiva Srishti into Ishwara Srishti . What was Universe before is now Universal form. What was secular before is sacred now. Only an attitudinal change. So what is the conclusion after seeing totality ? World does not deserve dwesha as it has beautiful things and events.  World also does not deserve raga as it has terrible things.  Just see it as it as and develop reverence and humility dropping aham and mama. 

#### what is vishwaroopa bakthi 

How do you express this mature bhakti? What is the definition of mature bhakti; meditate on this. definition of mature bhakti is reverential and calm acceptance of the unfavourable prārabdhā; ripening for me and the ripening for the close family members; this calm reverential acceptance which Śaṅkarācārya defines in Vivēkacudamani sahanam sarva dukhānām learn to put up with all the sufferings; apradhikāra purvakam without allowing the sufferings to generate negative thought like bitterness, anger, hatred etc. that is the pratikāra without allowing the suffering to generate pratikāra like anger, hatred bitterness etc., cintah vilāpa rahitam without continuous murmuring and grumbling and without pulling down the face. If you can do that, that is called viśva-rūpa bhakti.

To use my expression triple-C bhakti; that is defined as calm-cheerful and confident in and through adverse circumstances. This is the sign of viśva-rūpa bhakti and how do you express that viśva-rūpa bhakta. That is whenever adverse situation comes, and you are ranting and shouting; how do you change your attitude, go to your pūjā room and do a namaskāra and say Oh Lord whatever you do I accept calmly and reverentially to viśva-rūpa Īśvara and you have to see the transformation and Arjuna is now coming to the third stage wonderment is over; fear is over and now viśva-rūpa-bhakti is taking over him indicated by namaskritva. 

#### a truly beautiful passage on how Iswara Jnanam and Vishwa roopaJnanam has to result in removal of all envy/pride/anger etc. resulting in true bakthi

This reverential admiration of everything, micro and macro, every being - micro and macro; every event- micro and macro; this reverential admiration is viśva-rūpa-bhakthi. And here Arjuna says if a person has viśva-rūpa Īśvara-jñānam in depth, bhakthi is a natural consequence. We cannot force viśva-rūpa bhakthi. It can never be forced; it must be a natural consequence of assimilating viśva-rūpa Īśvara-svarūpam. We cannot work on bhakthi, we can work on jñānam only. It is more like nourishing a tree, you want to have the leaves to be green and bright, but you pour water at the roots. Jñānam is the root, bhakti is the blossom. Therefore Arjuna says all these great bhakthās now that they have this knowledge; they are helplessly your bhakthās. There problem is what: they are helplessly your bhakthās; they cannot be otherwise. Therefore, I would not ask the question why they are worshipping you; I will ask a counter-question, how they can avoid worshipping you. No more I ask why they are worshipping you? Now my question is how can they avoid worshipping you. Worship is a physical expression of an attitude born out of understanding.

#### Humble pranams to Swami P for magically appearing yesterday and making this explanation so rich and meaningful.


## Verse 39 - Namas 105 & 106 - Aug 22 

105. सहस्राराम्बुजारूढा - Sahasraranbujaruda

This nama is advanced Kundalini theory which I have to admit I have very little clue and basically it says when Kundalini Sakthi reaches the Sahasrara chakra the "breakthrough" happens.  Lord Krishna captures this in 2 slokas of the Gita in Chapter 8 and just reading them is enough to make you run towards Jnana Yoga taking the first available flight.  The conditions laid down for the "pranic energy" to rise to its peak and the extent of discipline and practice required is nothing short of climbing Everest in reverse.  If you are interested pls read up on Kundalini rising across the chakras (the Om Swami book is a good resource) or you can read Gita between slokas 8.10 & 8.12


106. सुधा-साराभिवर्षिणी - sudhasarabhivarshinee

There is one 'soma chakra' in the middle of sahasrāra. When Kuṇḍalinī reaches this cakra, out of the heat generated by Her presence, the ambrosia which is stored there gets melted and drips through the throat andenters the entire nervous system. There is a beautiful description of the by Swami Sarvapriyananda narrating the Maha Samadhi experience of Swami Vivekananda.  When you have the time pls listen to this Youtube link.
