рд╢реНрд░реАрдорд╛рддрд╛- ┼Ыr─лm─Бt─Б

The Supreme mother as the substratum and creator/sustainer/dissolver of the universe is how LS begins. When Sri is added as a prefix to any word, it shows the greatness (every rule has an exception and i stand as the shining example of that exception to this rule ЁЯЩВ) . The human mother goes great lengths including sacrificing everything at her disposal for the sake of her child but does not have the special power to alleviate the child's sufferings and miseries (scriptures call it Tapatrayam - 3 fires) . Worshiping the Goddess as divine mother is acknowledging that with  Her grace we will be able to overcome this samsara with ease and gain the necessary courage to swim through effortlessly.  As Spji says in one of his speeches - God does not have any grandchildren and hence she is Srimata to all. 

As we go forward in LS, you will notice that the ultimate prayer is to grant us "fearlessness" and not somehow magically rewrite the prarabdh of this birth and load it on some other poor bloke. Again quoting Spji - The person who you think you are will never be free from the prarabdh of this birth, but You will be free of that person. 

Saint Durvasa prays to Sri Mata saying " Oh ! SriMata ! the Supreme compassionate ! I had been born to a number of mothers. In the future also, I will/may be born to a number of mothers. My mothers are countless, as I had a different mother for my different births. I am so scared to be born again and again and to undergo the associated sufferings (Here Swami Vivekananda says even what is so called punyam is nothing but being bound by a gold chain keeping us firmly in this rebirth cycle). Oh ! Mata ! I am surrendering to you. Please give me releif from my future births" 

It is very pertinent to note that LS begins by addressing Lalithambike as the mother of all, which emphasizes Her compassion for the universe and its beings.  And this concept of compassion is not alien to other scriptures.  In what is probably the most touching sloka of the Gita, in 10.11 Lord says рддреЗрд╖рд╛рдореЗрд╡рд╛рдиреБрдХрдореНрдкрд╛рд░реНрдердорд╣рдордЬреНрдЮрд╛рдирдЬрдВ рддрдо: = Out of compassion for them, I, who dwell within their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance, with the luminous lamp of knowledge = by giving us the right guru who will lead us to our goal.
