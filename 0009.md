# nama 9 / 1000 - Apr 17

क्रोधाकाराङ्कुशोज्ज्वला- krodhākārāṅkuśojjvalā 

Same logic as the previous nama and while nama 8 covered the topic of ‘desire’ this nama covers ‘anger’. 

The nama means - She holds an elephant hook (in her right upper arm) . Krodha means anger/hatred,  akara means knowledge & Ankusham means elephant hook & ujjvala = shining.   She uses this elephant hook to destroy the anger/hatred if developed in her Devotees and gives them right knowledge.  The right lower arm is represented by Sampathri Devi (i am listing these names as they come later in the LS and will be important for us to tie back to this nama).  Dont want to belabour the points mentioned during Nama 8 on the qualified devotee and the grace of the Divine mother. 

Worthwhile to make a point on how anger/hatred even pops up and why Lord Krishna cited it as 1 of 2 evils and why the LS starts with the need to address the exact same 2 topics. Gita sloka 2.62 and 2.63  goes like this listing the 8 steps to total ruin in this body/mind

(1) For a person who is constantly thinking of the sense objects (2) a fondness for them arises (3) From fondness desire is born  (4) From desire comes anger (5) From anger arises delusion (6) delusion results  in the loss of memory - forgets the teachings of the scriptures (7) From the loss of memory (results) the loss of discrimination between right and wrong (8) Because of the loss of discrimination He totally perishes (and continues in this rebirth cycle) 

Important here to analyse why and how anger comes from desires.  

Desires--> fulfilled--> more desires -->become bigger and bigger as there is always the sense of incompleteness--> Outsized Desires-->when Unfulfilled-->anger-->downward spiral starts

For this advanced group did not want to go into a moral science discourse on permitted (dharmic) v. non-permitted desires(adharmic, excessive, hoarding etc) All of you very well understand the difference of what is being referred to here. 

The divine mother with her 'noose' and 'elephant hook' is there to fix the 2 most fundamental issues that trip us up everyday provided we are a qualified seeker . 

I am guessing Sage Vyasa is a bit upset with himself that he did not add a footnote to Gita 2.64 to push everyone chant LS.  In fact in all established Veda Paatashallas (vedic schools), every young student is taught to chant LS and they chant it daily rain or shine just to seek the Divine Mother's blessings to seek to overcome desire and anger apart from of course the other blessings. 

Ishwara Kripa (or grace) truly manifests itself only as Sastram and Guru.  Remember Sage Narada had diplomatic passport to all 3 Lokas and could get darshan of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva daily along with their consorts anytime he chose. But was never fulfilled as he felt there was always something lacking. Only after a penance to Brahmaji and the subsequent tuition he received on Atma Jnanam from Sage Sanathkumara did Narada attain Mukthi (detailed in Chap 7 of Chandogya Upanishad - attaching link to verse below). And Sanathkumara was none other than Lord Karthikey (Skanda) . Even for a dedicated bakth like Narada, who his entire life kept chanting “Narayana Narayana”,  was given a “different” Guru to enable him realise the ultimate non dual truth. This ties in nicely with our earlier conclusion that the form of God is quite irrelevant but what is important is the teaching and shraddha in the scriptures and subsequent saadhana. So remember after all your jaap and prayers to your Ishta devata, someone else appears to give you atma jnanam don’t shoo Him/Her away 😀. More of this in the next nama.
