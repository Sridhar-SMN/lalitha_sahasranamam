## सम्पत्करी-समारूढ-सिन्धुर-व्रज-सेविता - sampatkarī-samārūḍha-sindhura-vraja-sevitā 

She is worshipped by herds of elephants headed by Sampatkarī.  You would remember that in nama 9 - Apr 17th where we discussed the elephant hook (that is used to subdue our anger/hatred) and during that nama we saw that the hand holding the elephant hook is represented by Sampatkari Devi.  Of course this nama is much more involved as we will see below. For the Vedantins in the group this nama will surely be down your alley. 

### Caution : very heavy and involved nama - so read ahead at your own peril 

As per puranic literature the objects of the senses are called elephants. Every aspect of knowledge in the mind has 3 distinct parts - Knowledge, Knower & Known (referred to as the Triad).  Typically when engrossed in or trapped by ignorance we see the Triad as separate and hence all the consequent raga/dvesha and the whole jing bang and full monty karmic cycle of ignorance-birth-death-birth-death-birth unending loop. 

The knowledge (or mental modification thanks to the divine blessing of Jnanam) of realising that all the three are the same is called sukha-sampatkari. To the ordinary person the connection between the receiver and the thing received seems natural, but the peculiarity of Jnanis is that they carefully discriminate the triad realising the object of the senses are his/her own mental ideas.  

This is very involved to explain and 2 slokas in our scriptures do a fabulous job. In Dakshinamurthy Stotram # 2, Adi Shankaracharya carefully lays down how with the birth of Ahamkara (thanks to Avidya), you the Atman now deluded by the power of Maya wear the time space goggles and start seeing the Triad whereas all along it the same reality and everything appearing in the same reality (like a dream for the waker lying on the bed) . He writes - मायाकल्पितदेशकालकलना वैचित्र्यचित्रीकृतम्  - Maayaa-Kalpita-Desha-Kaala-Kalanaa Vaicitrya-Citrii-Krtam = it is only under the influence of Maya do you under the grip of time and space see objects as different to you like a dreamer using his nidra sakthi projects the whole dream world including himself as the dream body/mind.  Like once the dreamer wakes up the dream’s mithyathva is established in a similar way when the waker is awakened from his sleep (sukha sampatkari) he sees everything is nothing but one reality appearing as manifold. It is not the world does not exist (unlike a dream which is extinguished) but the futility of seeing something as different to you is gone. 

This is also beautifully brought out by Gaudapadacharya in Mandukya Karikas 3.31 

मनोदृश्यमिदं द्वैतं यत्किंचित्सचराचरम् । मनसो ह्यमनीभावे द्वैतं नैवोपलभ्यते ॥ 
manodṛśyamidaṃ dvaitaṃ yatkiṃcitsacarācaram | manaso hyamanībhāve dvaitaṃ naivopalabhyate || 

meaning : All these dual objects, comprising everything that is movable and immovable, perceived by the mind (are mind alone). For, duality is never experienced when the mind ceases to act. Which is why in deep sleep you have ignorance of your true nature but don’t make the mistake of thinking you are this body/mind as the mind has ceased to be active tool in deep sleep. 

And in 3.32 he goes on to add 

आत्मसत्यानुबोधेन न संकल्पयते यदा । अमनस्तां तदा याति ग्राह्याभावे तदग्रहम् ॥ 
ātmasatyānubodhena na saṃkalpayate yadā |  amanastāṃ tadā yāti grāhyābhāve tadagraham || 32 ||

Meaning : When the mind does not imagine on account of the knowledge of the Truth which is Ātman, then it ceases to be mind and becomes free from all idea of cognition, for want of objects to be cognised. (Fans of Kandar Anubhuthi will see strong parallel to this nama and KA 12 where AruNagirinathar says - அம்மா, பொருளொன்றும்  அறிந்திலனே which we saw briefly in yesterday’s footnote when understanding Vishwaroopa darshan) 

Lord Krishna brings this out in probably the greatest verse of the Gita in 2.16 where he says - "Of the unreal there is no being; the real has no nonexistence. But the nature of both these, indeed, has been realized by the seers of Truth”

So here the divine mother with the herd of elephants (& the hook to control) will bless the devotee to witness the foolishness of seeing things/world as different from himself/herself and realise that the Triad seen as a Triad or different is a flawed vision.

Footnote 

#### Transcribing the words of David Godman (quoting Ramana Maharshi) 

If you see something as separate from you then it is the wrong cognition or wrong perception. He says if everything that you see or you know directly to be your own Self and is not separate from you in the sense that there is no “I” inside you perceiving something out there, he says then that is the correct understanding the correct experience of the world. He is not saying that it is not there but what he is saying is you have got a superimposition of a wrong idea. What you are seeing is an external thing which you take to be real but it essentially is the Self/Reality in which appears you and the world and so long as you imagine you are in that body looking at the world, you are going to suffer.  But he says once you get rid of the person inside who is looking outside at something then you find your own natural state (Sampatkari of LS)

## अश्वारूढाधिष्ठिताश्व-कोटि-कोटिभिरावृता  -aśvārūḍhādhiṣṭhitāśva-koṭi-koṭibhirāvṛtā

The nama simply means - Lalithambike is surrounded my many horses headed by Aśvārūḍhā Devi, about whom we have discussed in nāma 8 (Apr 14).   The use of horses to denote our 5 senses is one of the often used prop of our scriptures.  It first appears in Katho Upanishad and Lord Krishna borrows it heavily in the Gita. 

Verses 1.3.3–11 of Katho Upanishad deal with the allegoric expression of human body as a chariot. The body is equated to a chariot where the horses are the senses, the mind is the reins, and the driver or charioteer is the intellect. The passenger of the chariot is the Self (Atman). Through this analogy, it is explained that the Atman is separate from the physical body, just as the passenger of a chariot is separate from the chariot. The verses conclude by describing control of the chariot and contemplation on the Self as ways by which the intellect acquires Self Knowledge. The initial polishing of the mind and control of senses is preparation of the mind to receive the blessing of knowledge (Lord Krishna captures this part nicely in sloka 5.07 & 5.10) 

In Gita 3.40 Lord Krishna says - 

तस्मात्त्वमिन्द्रियाण्यादौ नियम्य भरतर्षभ | पाप्मानं प्रजहि ह्येनं ज्ञानविज्ञाननाशनम् || 
tasmāt tvam indriyāṇyādau niyamya bharatarṣhabha, pāpmānaṁ prajahi hyenaṁ jñāna-vijñāna-nāśhanam

Therefore, Arjuna), controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing called sense pleasure, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation. This is called Dama (controlling the senses) in Sadhana Chatushtayam.  This of course is the initial stage of the practice but this nama in LS is a lot more deeper. Now you have to read this carefully with the previous nama - subduing the senses does not mean having no thought in the senses or mind (Chitta Vritti Nirudaha as what Yoga Sastra says)  but realising eventually that everything including the sense inputs and the mind are not You (गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्त of Gita 3.28 - guṇā guṇeṣhu vartanta = the sense objects are interacting with the body/senses/mind and you are merely the witness Atman). Imagine you are the passenger in that chariot and everything is merely appearing in your consciousness/vision including the horses, reins, chariot and charioteer.  

It is here that Divine Mother guides us by giving us the right guru+ scripture combo to light the lamp of knowledge in our minds. 

Next post on Asia Monday . Wishing all a blessed weekend .

footnote : 

A gem from Osho : Absence of darkness is light does not mean one needs to fight to remove darkness. The issue has to be addressed from the opposite side - bring light in and remove the darkness. Similarly Chith Vritti’s absence is Yog does not mean fight to erase Chith Vritti. Instead get the lamp of light into the equation and you will notice even that is illumined by Atman.  It is this aspect that is highlighted in nama 66 & 67
