## चक्रराज-रथारूढ-सर्वायुध-परिष्कृता - cakrarāja-rathārūḍha-sarvāyudha-pariṣkṛtā

Cakrarāja is the chariot of Lalitāmbikā in which She travels along with all types of weapons. Weapons mean the ways of attaining suddhavidyā or pure knowledge which is called the knowledge of the Brahman (pls refer back to nama 25 & 26 on May 1 re: Shuddha Vidhya - Pure knowledge). Cakrarāja also means the six cakras (mūlādhārā to ājña). Ratha means base or foundation. Arūḍha means control and sarvāyudha means pure knowledge which is called suddhavidyā.  Pariṣkṛtā means adorned. (with all the weapons).  if you tie this in with Kundalini theory then you will see the "travel" of the coiled Kundalini Sakthi from the Muladhara to Ajna is how Yogis view their upward spiritual journey. 

Suddhavidyā is possible only if māyā goes.  Lord Krishna cannot be more explicit in clarifying this when he says in Gita 4.33 

श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञ: परन्तप | सर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते ||
śhreyān dravya-mayād yajñāj jñāna-yajñaḥ parantapa; sarvaṁ karmākhilaṁ pārtha jñāne parisamāpyate

Adi Shankaracharya's explanation of this Gita sloka is one for the ages and it so happens to be one of the favorite slokas of Swami P . Quoting Shankara below 

O destroyer of enemies (parantapa - what a beautiful way to call Arjuna when referring to Knowledge burning away all ignorance - K1 is truly adorable), jnana-yajnah, Knowledge considered as a sacrifice; is sreyan, greater; dravyamayat yajnat, than sacrifices requiring materials [Including study of the Vedas, etc. also.] For, a sacrifice performed with materials is an originator of results, [Worldly prosperity, attaining heaven, etc basically karma phalam.], but Knowledge considered as a sacrifice is not productive of results. It only reveals the state of Liberation that is an achieved fact - pls ponder on “achieved fact”. Liberation consists in the removal of ignorance by Illumination. Nothing new is produced theory and as such no karma phalam. Hence it is greater & more praiseworthy. How? Because, sarvam, all; karma-akhilam, actions in their totality, without exception; O son of Prtha, parisamapyate, culminate, get merged (attain their consummation); jnane, in Knowledge, which is a means to Liberation.

## गेयचक्र-रथारूढ-मन्त्रिणी-परिसेविता - geyacakra-rathārūḍha-mantriṇī-parisevitā

2 other chariots are supposed the accompany the chariot of Cakraraja that we saw in nama 68. Out of the two, the first one is being discussed here, which is called Geyacakra chariot. This is the chariot of Mantrinī Devi who is also called Śyamalā Devi, about whom we have discussed in nama 10 re the sweet juice of sugarcane which we reinterpreted as the bow representing appropriate knowledge.  Geya =  to be praised; Cakra, = wheel; Ratha, the disk of the sun. 

Mantrini Devi the charioteer is the essence of all mantras. The illuminating “I” consciousness existing as an essential constituent of various mantras (like Pañcadaśī and ṣodaśī), whose essence is the knowledge of realizing the Brahman, is the secret of any mantra. Therefore mantras are not just the combination of letters, but the Śaktī Herself. (many places in the Gita, Lord Krishna says he is OM, the Mantras, the Vedas etc - same concept here). Hence these letters are called Mātṛka . Mātṛka means coming from or belonging to a mother. In this nāma, the importance of mantra and considering our own body as one with Śrī Cakra are emphasized. Considering our body as the one with Śrī Cakra means that She is not different from us, the main principle of Self-realization.

## किरिचक्र-रथारूढ-दण्डनाथा-पुरस्कृता - kiricakra-rathārūḍha-daṇḍanāthā-puraskṛtā

Kiricakra ratha is the chariot of Daṇḍanāthā Devi who is also called Vārāhī Devi. This Devi is considered as very powerful and was already discussed in nama 11 (Apr 19)  where we introduced the concept of "phal" - the sharp tip of the arrow.

Kiricahra: Kiri = beams of the light (Kiravas) of Creation; Cakra = the cycle of creation, preservation and destruction. Even though the Yogin has mounted the chariot Kiricakra and is entangled in the cycle of Creation, Preservation and Destruction, he is (Apuraskrta) beyond the scope, reach or touch of Dandanatha (Yama or Death; not to be confused with Dhandayudha). This is the fruit of knowledge delivered by Varahi Devi to the mind of the purified seeker.

Footnote 

Thirupugazh fans will want to ponder if the reference to Mātṛka in மாத்ருகா புஷ்ப மாலை of the ஆசைகூர் பத்தனே song has  any connection to this nama - till now we have been taking it to mean the 51 alphabets of the Sanskrit language or some flower arrangement - looks like we may have missed a trick of 2. Interesting to note that Kandar Anubhuthi is also exactly 51 verses. Something is going on here but not able to point to it exactly. Hopefully will dawn on us one day.
