## 118. भक्तिप्रिया - Bhakti-priya

She is fond of devotion. Śivānanda Laharī  describes devotion as -  “The way needle seeks magnet, the way creeper seeks tree, the way river unites with ocean and the way the mind seeks the lotus feet of Śiva are called devotion”. Sage Nārada said ‘Devotion is beyond three guṇas – rajas, tamas and sattva. It is beyond desire. It grows every second. It remains connected with the God/Brahman. It is subtle and realized out of experience. Once realized, he always remains with That.

Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa Paramahamsa compares devotion to the flood that flows powerfully into the ocean in spite of the dams built to control the floods. Our mind, he continues, is not flowing but stagnant like a pond. Our mind gets stagnated towards devotion, which has to grow every second. Adi Shankaracharya in Viveka Chudamani (verse 31) says that “amongst things conducive to liberation, devotion alone holds the supreme place. The seeking after one’s real nature is designated as devotion. 

The point driven home in this nāma is that nothing prevents a true devotee in realizing Her irrespective of the hurdles. She is delighted with such devotion and such devotees. Devotees are those who worship Her through mind to seek Her within.
