She is fond of devotion. Śivānanda Laharī describes devotion as - “The way needle seeks magnet, the way creeper seeks tree, the way river unites with ocean and the way the mind seeks the lotus feet of Śiva are called devotion”. Sage Nārada said ‘Devotion is beyond three guṇas – rajas, tamas and sattva. It is beyond desire. It grows every second. It remains connected with the God/Brahman. It is subtle and realized out of experience. Once realized, he always remains with That.

Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa Paramahamsa compares devotion to the flood that flows powerfully into the ocean in spite of the dams built to control the floods. Our mind, he continues, is not flowing but stagnant like a pond. Our mind gets stagnated towards devotion, which has to grow every second. Adi Shankaracharya in Viveka Chudamani (verse 31) says that “amongst things conducive to liberation, devotion alone holds the supreme place. The seeking after one’s real nature is designated as devotion.

There are so many beautiful references in the Gita in chap 7,9,12 etc which glorify the beauty of Saguna Bakthi. In fact in Gita 3.30 the Lord actively pushes us to have total surrender of efforts and outcome to be delivered at His feet and then proceed with our daily lives. 

The point driven home in this nāma is that nothing prevents a true devotee in realizing Her irrespective of the hurdles. She is delighted with such devotion and such devotees. Devotees are those who worship Her through mind and ultimately put efforts to seek Her from within.

She can be attained only by devotion. Since She likes pure devotion in terms of the previous nama, She can be attained by such devotion only. Of course no can explain this better than Lord Krishna in the Gita and he brings this out in so many slokas. I would like to quote 9.34 (which is again repeated with a minor change in 18.65)  and its meaning 

मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु | मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ||
man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru; mām evaiṣhyasi yuktvaivam ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ

Manmana bhava, have your mind fixed on Me (Vasudeva) and also be madbhakah, devoted to Me. Madyaji, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And namaskuru, bow down; only mam, to Me. Yuktva, by concentrating your mind; and mat-parayanah, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; esyasi eva, you shall surely attain; mam, Me who am God. You shall attain Me evam atmanam, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word mam (Me). 

Nothing beats the crowning glory sloka # 18.55 in the Gita which is so beautifully explained by Adi Shankaracharya. As the explanation is a bit longish and so as to not making this post any longer, I am attaching the link for you to read assuring you this commentary by Adi Shankaracharya is the best you have read on all subjects this year - 

https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=18&field_nsutra_value=55&setgb=1&choose=1

*what is Saranagathi* ? Extract from a brilliant speech by Swami P explaining the word "Saranagathi" - The very word Shāstram means, that which protects the people. In-fact, the word Sharanam in the Sharanāgati has got the same meaning as the word Shāstram. Sharanam means protector and Shāstram also means protector. Sharanam is derived from the root ‘shru’. Shrunāti means to destroy the problem. Therefore, Sharanam means the protector, remover of problems. Shāstram also means protector - shāsanāt trāyatē iti shāstram. Therefore, according to the tradition, Sharanāgati means Shāstrāgatihi. So, have faith in God means have faith in the teachings of God. When we say teachings of the Lord, it is not the miracle stories. Miracle stories of the devotees are not the real part of the scriptures. They are only frills, peripherals of the scriptures. They are like the appetizers. The real part of the scriptures is the teaching regarding how to solve problems, what is human problem, what is the world, how does the world create problem etc. This teaching of the human being, the world, the problems and the solutions is the central Shāstram. Surrender to the Shāstram, receive the teaching and find the solution for your own problem because Bhagawān has provided solutions to all the problems.

Swami P says it best - There is no distinct branch called  Bakthi Yoga and then adds Karma Yoga (KY)  + Jnana Yoga (JY)  = Bakthi Yoga. In KY we are dependent on the Lord and in JY we are dependent on the Lord's teachings. Why so many people run away from Jnana Yoga claiming it to be optional and worse calling it an "intellectual stimulation for the unemployed" (aka Vedantin) remains a mystery that one can never understand. 

Wishing all a blessed weekend !

## 120. भक्तिवश्या - Bhakti-vashya - Sep 11

She is controlled by devotion or She is attracted by devotion. vashya means attraction or keeping under control. There are some beautiful stories from our Puranas on devotion and absolute surrender .I am sure you are all seasoned veterans on bakthi stories and I will try not to torture but instead will give some references from the Gita which might jog your memory on this topic. As an aside note the surrender of Prahalada, Vibhshana, Panchali, Ahalya, Gajendra & Dhruva etc while glorified in our puranas are still considered artha and artharthi bakthi only - lower 2 of the 4 levels of Bakthi. There is a beautiful prayer on Lord Vishnu which lists these bakthas and names Lord Vishnu as "Artharthrayana parayaNa sa Bhagavan".  And fans of Gajendra Moksham (GM) stotram may be intrigued to note as per the full story Gajendra did not get Moksh at the end of that story.   He was reborn later in human form and then subsequently attained Moksh. GM happens to be one of my favorite hymns, so if you would like to discuss pls feel free to ping me separately) 

Lord Krishna says in Gita 9.30 - “Even if the vilest sinner worships me with exclusive devotion, he should be accounted as a saint. He is positive in his belief that there is nothing like devoted worship of God,” and Lord proceeds to say in the next verse “that my devotee never perishes = is stuck in this never ending rebirth cycle”. But as a staunch advaitin the sloka from the Gita that deeply emphasises the importance of Bakthi towards Ishwara (Saguna Brahman) is sloka 13.19 (701 count)

इति क्षेत्रं तथा ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं चोक्तं समासत: | मद्भक्त एतद्विज्ञाय मद्भावायोपपद्यते || iti kṣhetraṁ tathā jñānaṁ jñeyaṁ choktaṁ samāsataḥ madh-bhakta etad vijñāya mad-bhāvāyopapadyate

I have thus revealed to you the nature of the field (body/mind/world), the meaning of knowledge (Jivatma), and the object of knowledge (Paramatma) & the oneness of Jivatma & Paramatma. Only My devotees can understand this in reality, and by doing so, they attain My divine nature.

The key word to highlight in this sloka (for Gita fans this needs to be linked back to 10.09-10.11) is मद्भक्त - madh baktha - only My devotee (not 'Mad' Baktha as is popularly misunderstood). Here the Baktha is one who sees the entire creation as nothing but the Divine Lord himself and is able to convert Vishwa (world) darshan into Vishwaroopa Darshan. It is only a cognitive change of seeing God in and as everything. And Lord says it is to such a baktha the ultimate knowledge will be revealed and thereby enabling him/her to understand the Jivatma/Parmatma oneness in this very birth.

To quell meaningless debates on Bakthi v. Jnana  and which is superior - Swami P says 

## Without Bakthi, Jnana is impossible and without Jnana, Bakthi is incomplete


## 121. भयापहा - Bhaya-paha - Sep 12 

I was really hoping to plagiarise big time from Adi Shankaracharya's commentary on Vishnu Sahasranamam as nama # 935 of VS is also Bhaya-Paha but much to my disappointment Shankarar has written a brief but a very very deep note. Explaining this Adi Shankaracharya writes - Bhaya-paha = The destroyer of fear.  In another nama of VS he calls Samsara as fear.  So that begs the question as to what is the meaning of Samsara and our scriptures have 2 definitions

a) Sam (Continuous & directionless) + Sara (travel.  this is from the root "Sru" to travel and Sara is the abstract noun) - Here the definition points to the continuous cycle of birth and death and being stuck in this punarapi jananam  & punarapi maranam unending cycle. But this definition is useless for those who dont believe in rebirth. 
b) So Adi Shankaracharya in his Gita Bashyam in the 13th chapter  gives another deeper meaning - he says samsara is the continuous cyclical occurence of sukham (joy) and dukham (sorrow) and in no particular expected pattern.

I will give 2 references and conclude the explanation of the nama 

- When Janaka obtained Self-Realisation what do you think his Guru said to him ? Normally you would expect him to have said - "Janaka, you are self realised, you are shining like the atman etc " .  No there was no such grand proclamation - instead the Guru said - "From today you have become fearless Janaka"

- And what is probably considered the most important sloka of the Gita, Lord Krishna in 18.66 says

सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज | अहं त्वां सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच: || 
sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja ; ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣhayiṣhyāmi mā śhuchaḥ

Adi Sankaracharya's commentary on this is an absolute epic and he draws out the profound teaching of "Tat Tvam Asi" from this sloka which we will see when explaining another nama. But what we are interested for the purposes of this nama are the last 2 words - मा शुच: (mā śhuchaḥ) = do not fear . The Lord after giving out the grand knowledge in the final teaching verse of the Gita pauses and says "do not fear" .

Exactly in the same way the Divine mother extinguishes Samsara for the dedicated devotee by giving him/her the knowledge  of the Atman (by arranging for the right guru to come and guide) removing all our fears.  Fear comes from limitation and identification with just this body/mind complex and hence the consequent insecurity and the greatest fear of all - death.  When we receive the knowledge of our true status as the Atman and learn it never dies (mainly because it was never born as birth or death is within time and time itself appears in Atman like how our dream time appears in our own mind) and consequently are removed from the shackles of limited identification with this one body/mind complex and therefore all fear evaporates.

### footnote - what the Upanishad say on Bhaya-Paha 

My Vedanta colleagues in this group will crucify me if I forget to quote this famous line from the Upanishads. 

In Brihadaranyaka up. I. iv. 2 there is the famous statement: dvitIyAd vai bhayam bhavati—Fear indeed arises from a second entity.

In reality there is only brahman as Lord Krishna explains in Gita 4.24. It is avidya (ignorance) that projects multiplicity and creates the appearance of different entities. It is only when a person sees others as different from himself that fear, etc., arise. In this upanishadic statement the term 'fear' is representative of all emotions such as desire, attachment, aversion, anger, jealousy, greed, etc. None of these can arise when a person sees no other being different from himself.

When a person realizes that the whole world including himself is nothing but brahman, he does not see any entity different from himself. Then no cause for fear or any of the other emotions mentioned above exists. This is the meaning of this mantra- dvitIyAd vai bhayam bhavati.. A jnAni does not see anything, living or non-living, different from himself (Gita 5.18). So he has no feelings such as fear, aversion, attachment, etc., towards any other creature, whether human being or wild animal or reptiles such as cobras, etc. This is what is described in the upanishads as 'abhayam', fearlessness.

The Upanishad also says: brahman is indeed abhayam, free from fear. He who knows it as his own Self becomes the fearless brahman.

The very recitation of the name of the Divine Mother will dispel fear. Always pls remember there is no magic here.  God sends the Guru who gives the knowledge.  No BR Chopra movie type magic show will occur and lights and bulbs will flash along with bells tolling.

## 122. शाम्भवी - Sambavi - Sep 13 

Lord Shiva is known as Sambu and His wife is Shambavi.  In Vishnu Sahasranamam the nama # 32 is Sambavah and Adi Shankaracharya explains it as "He manifests himself in suitable forms as per his will" . This is what Lord Krishna also explains in the famous Gita sloka 4.08 (every one knows it so well that I wont bore you again - परित्राणाय साधूनां ... युगे युगे) and is interpreted as ‘the one who gives comforts to devotees’. In that way both Lord Vishnu and Lalithambike give comfort to their devotees.

Sadhguru of the Isha Foundation fame also has popularised this mudra called the Sambavi Mudra used in Kundalini meditation. Focusing both the eye balls internally towards the center of eyebrows (ājña cakra). I dont know much on this so wont try to display my ignornace.

However there is hilarious and interesting contradiction that Lord Krishna poses in the Gita.  In Sloka 5.27, Lord suggests that when sitting for meditation apart from the other steps one has to focus the eyes upwards towards the center of the eyebrows and in effect suggesting that we follow the Sambavi Mudra of the Kundalini meditation.  However by the time he reaches sloka 6.13 of the Gita, he seems to have forgotten that he has asked Arjuna to follow the Sambavi Mudra and in 6.13 asks Arjuna to look down and focus at the tip of the nose. Of course if you give something like this to Swami P he is going to have a field day cracking all kinds of jokes.  This is what he has to say - and in the audio lecture he simply cant control his giggle 

"if you remember the fifth chapter sloka 5.27, you will get terribly confused. If you do not remember, you are lucky, because in the fifth chapter, Krishna says, look at between the eye brows; cakṣuścaivāntarē bhruvōḥ; here Krishna says look at the tip of the nose. Now Arjuna is confused and asks "now tell me; where should I look ?"; the very fact that Krishna is not consistent indicates Krishna is not very particular about where you look; whether tip of the nose or gap between the eyebrows; do not bother too much about those details; what is important; your eyes do not distract you; that is the spirit; and even if you want to close your eyes; perfectly OK; gently close your eyes as long as you dont go into dream state or worse deep sleep" 

so bottom line is I dont think this nama refers to the Mudra or any such theatrics and what Adi Sankaracharya says explaining the same nama in VS makes more sense and seems perfectly aligned to this section of the LS which talks about the Saguna Brahman, avatara theory and the importance of Saguna Bakthi towards the divine mother.
