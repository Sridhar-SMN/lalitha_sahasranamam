She is fond of devotion. Śivānanda Laharī describes devotion as - “The way needle seeks magnet, the way creeper seeks tree, the way river unites with ocean and the way the mind seeks the lotus feet of Śiva are called devotion”. Sage Nārada said ‘Devotion is beyond three guṇas – rajas, tamas and sattva. It is beyond desire. It grows every second. It remains connected with the God/Brahman. It is subtle and realized out of experience. Once realized, he always remains with That.

Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa Paramahamsa compares devotion to the flood that flows powerfully into the ocean in spite of the dams built to control the floods. Our mind, he continues, is not flowing but stagnant like a pond. Our mind gets stagnated towards devotion, which has to grow every second. Adi Shankaracharya in Viveka Chudamani (verse 31) says that “amongst things conducive to liberation, devotion alone holds the supreme place. The seeking after one’s real nature is designated as devotion.

There are so many beautiful references in the Gita in chap 7,9,12 etc which glorify the beauty of Saguna Bakthi. In fact in Gita 3.30 the Lord actively pushes us to have total surrender of efforts and outcome to be delivered at His feet and then proceed with our daily lives. 

The point driven home in this nāma is that nothing prevents a true devotee in realizing Her irrespective of the hurdles. She is delighted with such devotion and such devotees. Devotees are those who worship Her through mind and ultimately put efforts to seek Her from within.

She can be attained only by devotion. Since She likes pure devotion in terms of the previous nama, She can be attained by such devotion only. Of course no can explain this better than Lord Krishna in the Gita and he brings this out in so many slokas. I would like to quote 9.34 and its meaning and then 18.55 below with the link

मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु | मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ||
man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru; mām evaiṣhyasi yuktvaivam ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ

Manmana bhava, have your mind fixed on Me (Vasudeva) and also be madbhakah, devoted to Me. Madyaji, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And namaskuru, bow down; only mam, to Me. Yuktva, by concentrating your mind; and mat-parayanah, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; esyasi eva, you shall surely attain; mam, Me who am God. You shall attain Me evam atmanam, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word mam (Me). 

Nothing beats the crowning glory sloka # 18.55 (&18.65 but that I will reserve for a later torture) on Bakthi in the Gita which is so beautifully explained by Adi Shankaracharya. As the explanation is a bit longish and so as to not making this post any longer, I am attaching the link for you to read.!

Extract from a brilliant speech by Swami P explaining the word "Saranagathi" - The very word Shāstram means, that which protects the people. In-fact, the word Sharanam in the Sharanāgati has got the same meaning as the word Shāstram. Sharanam means protector and Shāstram also means protector. Sharanam is derived from the root ‘shru’. Shrunāti means to destroy the problem. Therefore, Sharanam means the protector, remover of problems. Shāstram also means protector - shāsanāt trāyatē iti shāstram. Therefore, according to the tradition, Sharanāgati means Shāstrāgatihi. So, have faith in God means have faith in the teachings of God. When we say teachings of the Lord, it is not the miracle stories. Miracle stories of the devotees are not the real part of the scriptures. They are only frills, peripherals of the scriptures. They are like the appetizers. The real part of the scriptures is the teaching regarding how to solve problems, what is human problem, what is the world, how does the world create problem etc. This teaching of the human being, the world, the problems and the solutions is the central Shāstram. Surrender to the Shāstram, receive the teaching and find the solution for your own problem because Bhagawān has provided solutions to all the problems.

Swami P says it best - There is no distinct branch called  Bakthi Yoga and then adds Karma Yoga (KY)  + Jnana Yoga (JY)  = Bakthi Yoga. In KY we are dependent on the Lord and in JY we are dependent on the Lord's teachings. Why so many people run away from Jnana Yoga claiming it to be optional and merely intellectual remains a mystery that one can never understand. 

Wishing all a blessed weekend !
