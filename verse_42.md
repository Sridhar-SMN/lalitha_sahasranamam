She is fond of devotion. Śivānanda Laharī  describes devotion as -  “The way needle seeks magnet, the way creeper seeks tree, the way river unites with ocean and the way the mind seeks the lotus feet of Śiva are called devotion”. Sage Nārada said ‘Devotion is beyond three guṇas – rajas, tamas and sattva. It is beyond desire. It grows every second. It remains connected with the God/Brahman. It is subtle and realized out of experience. Once realized, he always remains with That.

Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa Paramahamsa compares devotion to the flood that flows powerfully into the ocean in spite of the dams built to control the floods. Our mind, he continues, is not flowing but stagnant like a pond. Our mind gets stagnated towards devotion, which has to grow every second. Adi Shankaracharya in Viveka Chudamani (verse 31) says that “amongst things conducive to liberation, devotion alone holds the supreme place. The seeking after one’s real nature is designated as devotion. 

The point driven home in this nāma is that nothing prevents a true devotee in realizing Her irrespective of the hurdles. She is delighted with such devotion and such devotees. Devotees are those who worship Her through mind to seek Her within.

She can be attained only by devotion. Since She likes pure devotion in terms of the previous nama, She can be attained by such devotion only. Of course no can explain this better than Lord Krishna in the Gita and he brings this out in so many slokas. I would like to quote 9.34 and its meaning and then 18.55 below with the link

मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु | मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: ||
man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru; mām evaiṣhyasi yuktvaivam ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ

Manmana bhava, have your mind fixed on Me (Vasudeva) and also be madbhakah, devoted to Me. Madyaji, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And namaskuru, bow down; only mam, to Me. Yuktva, by concentrating your mind; and mat-parayanah, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; esyasi eva, you shall surely attain; mam, Me who am God. You shall attain Me evam atmanam, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word mam (Me). 

Of course nothing beats the crowning glory sloka # 18.55 on Bakthi in the Gita which is so beautifully explained by Adi Shankaracharya. As the explanation is a bit longish and so as to not making this post any longer, I am attaching the link for you to read. Swami P says it best - There is nothing called Bakthi Yoga separately and then adds Karma Yoga + Jnana Yoga = Bakthi Yoga. In KY we are dependent on the Lord and in JY we are dependent on the Lord's teachings. Why so many people run away from Jnana Yoga claiming it to be merely intellectual remains a mystery. I can guarantee you this link is the best you have read on any subject all year !
