## 126. शाङ्करी - Shankari - Sep 18 

Wife of Saṇkarā, a form of Siva, is known as Sāṃkarī. Śam means happiness and karā means doer. Therefore Saṇkarā is known to give happiness and his wife Śāṇakarī has the same quality. Siva and Saktī do not have any difference in "qualities" between them (have to be careful to understand this as Ishwara Anugraham based on the laws of nature and not that Gods have qualities like humans/jivas). That is why Śiva and Pārvatī are said to be father and mother of the universe. 

The famous poem of Kalidasa in रघुवम्श/raghuvamsha is used to describe this concept of Siva and Parvathi as parents of this Universe and is figuratively represented in the form of Ardhanareeshwarar. 

वागर्थाविव सम्पृक्तौ वागर्थ प्रतिपत्तये ।जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ॥ 
vaagarthaaviva sampRuktau vaagartha pratipattaye | jagataH pitarau vande paarvatIparameshvarau ||

We will see more of this in the namas on Prakriti, Maya etc and Lord Krishna borrows this concept in Chap 9 (9.17) and Chap 13 (13.19-13.23) in the Gita.  More on this later. 

## 127. श्रीकरी - Srikari - Sep 19 

We saw in Nama # 1 that "Sri" as a prefix means greatness.  In this context Srī means all types of prosperity. It also means wealth, happiness, beauty, attraction, auspiciousness, etc. Since She is the embodiment of all these qualities and also endows these qualities on Her devotees, She is known as Śrīkarī. 

Vishnu Saharanamam nama 611 is Śrīkarā which means the giver of wealth to His devotees. And it is here we need to pay attention to Shankaracharya's commentary on that nama in VS which is equally applicable here. He explains the nama as "conferor of Sri on those devotees that remember, praise & worship Him". We saw in nama #120 on Sep 11 the meaning of "my devotee - madh baktha" . pls link that here. 

"Conferor of Sri" means what ?  For this we need to go to the previous nama in VS which is "Sridharah" and Shankaracharya explains this as "The bearer of Sri - He keeps on his chest Goddess Lakshmi, the mother of all" - in effect the supporter of all prosperities. But Shankaracharya will be disappointed if we equate Lakshmi or Lalithambike with material prosperity -  At the end of his prayer to Goddess Lakshmi in Kanakadhara Stotram the final plea that Shankarar chants is so beautiful 

dēvi prasīda jagadīśvari lōkamātaḥ
kalyāṇadātri kamalēkṣaṇajīvanāthē |
dāridryabhītihr̥dayaṁ śaraṇāgataṁ mām
ālōkaya pratidinaṁ sadayairapāṅgaiḥ

Want to draw your attention to the 3rd line - dāridryabhītihr̥dayaṁ śaraṇāgataṁ mām - here Shankarar says he is not surrendering to obtain wealth/money/gold & relief from material poverty  but relief he is seeking is from the poverty that is afflicting the mind - the poverty caused by ignorance of our true nature.
