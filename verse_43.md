## 126. शाङ्करी - Shankari - Sep 18 

Wife of Saṇkarā, a form of Siva, is known as Sāṃkarī. Śam means happiness and karā means doer. Therefore Saṇkarā is known to give happiness and his wife Śāṇakarī has the same quality. Siva and Saktī do not have any difference in "qualities" between them (have to be careful to understand this as Ishwara Anugraham based on the laws of nature and not that Gods have qualities like humans/jivas). That is why Śiva and Pārvatī are said to be father and mother of the universe. 

The famous poem of Kalidasa in रघुवम्श/raghuvamsha is used to describe this concept of Siva and Parvathi as parents of this Universe and is figuratively represented in the form of Ardhanareeshwarar. 

वागर्थाविव सम्पृक्तौ वागर्थ प्रतिपत्तये ।जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ॥ 
vaagarthaaviva sampRuktau vaagartha pratipattaye | jagataH pitarau vande paarvatIparameshvarau ||

We will see more of this in the namas on Prakriti, Maya etc and Lord Krishna borrows this concept in Chap 9 (9.17) and Chap 13 (13.19-13.23) in the Gita.  More on this later. 

## 127. श्रीकरी - Srikari - Sep 19 

We saw in Nama # 1 that "Sri" as a prefix means greatness.  In this context Srī means all types of prosperity. It also means wealth, happiness, beauty, attraction, auspiciousness, etc. Since She is the embodiment of all these qualities and also endows these qualities on Her devotees, She is known as Śrīkarī. 

Vishnu Saharanamam nama 611 is Śrīkarā which means the giver of wealth to His devotees. And it is here we need to pay attention to Shankaracharya's commentary on that nama in VS which is equally applicable here. He explains the nama as "conferor of Sri on those devotees that remember, praise & worship Him". We saw in nama #120 on Sep 11 the meaning of "my devotee - madh baktha" . pls link that here. 

"Conferor of Sri" means what ?  For this we need to go to the previous nama in VS which is "Sridharah" and Shankaracharya explains this as "The bearer of Sri - He keeps on his chest Goddess Lakshmi, the mother of all" - in effect the supporter of all prosperities. But Shankaracharya will be disappointed if we equate Lakshmi or Lalithambike with material prosperity -  At the end of his prayer to Goddess Lakshmi in Kanakadhara Stotram the final plea that Shankarar chants is so beautiful 

dēvi prasīda jagadīśvari lōkamātaḥ
kalyāṇadātri kamalēkṣaṇajīvanāthē |
dāridryabhītihr̥dayaṁ śaraṇāgataṁ mām
ālōkaya pratidinaṁ sadayairapāṅgaiḥ

Want to draw your attention to the 3rd part - dāridryabhītihr̥dayaṁ śaraṇāgataṁ mām - here Shankarar says he is not surrendering to obtain wealth/money/gold & relief from material poverty  but relief he is seeking is from the poverty that is afflicting the mind - the poverty caused by ignorance of our true nature. 


## 128. साध्वी - Sadhvi - Sep 20

The nama refers to the purity and chastity, however not how we typically understand but chaste thru knowledge. Lalithambike is called as chaste because, She always remains with Śiva. And as we saw earlier the nama Shiva/Siva represents true knowledge/bliss/ananda.  She considers Śiva as pati deva just as a wife who regards her husband as divine and vice verse. This is the right explanation for this nāma as She was 'created' by Śiva and therefore She considers Śiva as Her divine husband. ‘Pati vedanaḥ’ means Śiva. For Tamil speakers pls dont crack up here - It is Vedanah not Vedanai-வேதனை (for non tamil speakers வேதனை means worry :-)) . Vedanaḥ means perception or knowledge and pati vedanaḥ means possessor of knowledge.

Taking Śiva as nirguṇa Brahman or the Brahman without attributes and his consort (Maya sakthi)  is Nirguna Brahman+Maya Sakthi = Saguṇa Brahman, as She is endowed with all the energies for creation,sustenance and dissolution.

## 129. शरच्चन्द्र-निभानना - sarachandra nibhanana - Sep 21 

Her face appears like the moon in spring season. Sarad means second half of October, November and first half of December. In a natural horoscope, each rāśi represents a solar month. Two solar months make a ṛtu and six ṛtu-s make a year. During śarad ṛtu (autumn or fall season) the moon appears brighter and without blemishes.  

## 130. शातोदरी - Shatodari - Sep 21 

She has thin waist. These two namass (129 and 130) are connected to Her kāmakalā form, the details of which will be discussed in kāmakalā rūpā (nāma 322)

## 131. शान्तिमती - Shantimati - Sep 22

This nama typically gets translated as "peaceful" when defining the Divine mother but that does little to let us know what we need to get there. So will borrow from 2 slokas of the Gita to explain this nama.  "Shanti" is also one of the qualities listed in the 13th chapter of the Gita which are requirement for being eligible to receive the highest truth. 

In Chapter 4 of the Gita Lord Krishna in 2 slokas explains to us what "Shanti" truly means 

न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा | इति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते || 4.14 

वीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिता: | बहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागता: || 4.10 

Let us take 4.14 first as 4.10 is probably one of the most comprehensive slokas of the Gita.   In 4.14, Lord Krishna is setting the stage for the grand crescendo he is going to reach in 4.18-4.24.   What he is essentially trying to say in 4.14 is that as Lord Krishna the Saguna Brahman/Ishwara/Bhagawan he can never be at peace if he identifies himself with the role. For each of us we are subjected to the ups and downs we go thru in one mind and it becomes crazy at times. Imagine as the Omniscient Lord/Divine Mother, they were to identify with the highs and lows of each Jiva, their existence will become miserable.  As Swami P says even the Lord attains eternal peace (Shanti) only by identifying with His/Her higher nature and knowing fully well that the play of Prakriti/Maya is never going to affect them just like a movie screen is not affected by the tradegy or comedy it helps project. Adi Shankaracharya beautifully explains 4.14 thus: 

"Because of the absence of egoism, those karmani, actions; na limpanti, do not taint; mam, Me, by becoming the originators of body etc. And me, for Me; na sprha, there is no hankering for the results of those actions. But in the case of transmigrating beings, who have self-identification in the form, 'I am the agent', and thirst for actions as also for their results, it is reasonable that actions should taint them. Owing to the absence of these, actions do not taint Me. Anyone else, too, yah, who; abhijanati, knows; mam, Me; iti, thus, as his own Self, and (knows), 'I am not an agent; I have no hankering for the results of actions'; sah, he; na badhyate, does not become bound; karmabhih, by actions. In his case also actions cease to be the originators of body etc. This is the import."

The tool on how to achieve this is explained in sloka 4.10 - if fate walks to you and says it wants to snatch away from your memory and understanding all the slokas of the Gita barring one and gives you a choice to pick 1 sloka that you would want to keep, then I suggest you pick 4.10.  Explaining this Swami P says 

4.10 breakdown by rearranging the words of the sloka

वीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिता: | बहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागता: || 

वीतरागभयक्रोधा ( Vairagyam & then Karma Yoga)
बहवो ज्ञानतपसा (sincere Shravanam, Mananam & Nidhidhyasanam followed by the Jnana Yogis) 
मामुपाश्रिता: (an attitudinal change to move towards Athma-Anathma format from Jiva-Jagat-Ishwara format) 
पूता मद्भावमागता: (attained Videha Mukthi realising the never had Janma in first place) 
मन्मया (Achieved Jivatma Parmatma aikyam)

And again quoting Adi Shankaracharya here - and the most gratifying word for me in this sloka is Bahavah (many) -  If the Lord says many have attained eternal peace/Shanti following the teachings of this sloka, then it is good enough guarantee for me. 

"Bahavah, many; vita-raga-bhaya-krodhah, who were devoid of attachment, fear and anger; manmayah, who were absorbed in Me, who were knowers of Brahman, who were seers of (their) identity with God; mam upasrithah, who had taken refuge only in Me, the supreme God, i.e. who were steadfast in Knowledge alone; and were putah, purified, who had become supremely sanctified; jnana-tapasa, by the austerity of Knowledge-Knowledge itself, about the supreme Reality, being the austerity; becoming sanctified by that austerity of Knowledge-; agatah, have attained; madbhavam, My state, Goodhood, Liberation. The particular mention of 'the austerity of Knowledge' is to indicate that steadfastness in Knowledge does not depend on any other austerity."

I am guessing even doing our best to follow 4.10 will give us tremendous peace of mind (Shanti) whether or not we get the grand prize of Self Realisation in this very birth. 

### freed from the need to keep it somewhat short to have to post on whatsapp I suddenly find myself at liberty to keep going for pages till I am satisfied that I have understood it fully. 

## 132. निराधारा - Niradhara - Sep 25

Starting from this name till 195 is the Nirugna svarupam of Lalithambike and like we saw in Nama 131, firmly established in this knowledge does Saguna Brahman/Ishwara/Divine Mother descend into an avatara or form.  As we saw earlier Saguna Brahman descends down as an avatara out of compassion whereas a Jiva falls into samsara out of passion.   Niradhara - adhara means support and nir+adhara is without support or without need for support - it simply translates as supportless supporter of the world. Just like the waker’s mind supports the dream, Brahman/Consciousness supports this entire universe of living and non living beings. 

To best grasp this concept, our scriptures recommend using space/akasha (here akasha is not sky but space) as a good proxy to understand how to best relate to Brahman. For this Nama we will focus on # 7 - Sarva adharatvam 

1. Ēkathvam. Both are only one. Ātma Ēkaḥ. ākāśaḥ Ēkaḥ.
2. Sarva vyapakathvyam. Ātma is all-pervading. ākāśaḥ is all pervading. 
3. Acalatvam - Being all pervading, ātma cannot move from one place to another, ākāśaḥ cannot also move. 
4. Nirvikārathvam. ākāśaḥ remains the same. It does not get older or younger. It does not get out of shape; all these are for objects in ākāśaḥ, ākāśaḥ itself is Nirvikara, ātma is also nirvikāra. 
5. Akhandathvam. Ātma is part-less. Khanda means part. ākāśaḥ also does not have part. ākāśaḥ is indivisible and ākāśaḥ and 
6. ātma and akashah are asaṅgaḥ - untainted by what happens in them  (this was highlighted in Nama 131 where Saguna Brahman derives true peace by remaining unattached/untainted)
7.  ākāśaḥ is sarva adharatvam. It accommodates, supports everything. The whole cosmos is located in ākāśaḥ, therefore ākāśaḥ is viśvādhāram, and Bhagavān is also; ātma is ALSO viśvādhāram. That is why in Vishnu Sahasranama, after viśvādhāram, what comes; gaganasadruśam. gaganam, means ākāśaḥ. And therefore, ātma is like ākāśaḥ. 
8. And one more, Sūkṣmatvam. ākāśaḥ cannot be easily comprehended intellectually 

Lord Krishna brings this out beautifully in 9.04 and 9.05 of the Gita where he explains how the world seemingly rests in Him (as Brahman) while clarifying He is not in them. 


## 133. निरञ्जना - Niranjana - Sep 26

Anjana, black,  attached to ignorance because ignorance has the quality of veiling (nature) owing to its quality of darkness. The Yogaväsistha says, "Existence and non-existence of (desired) objects produce joy and sorrow. O Rama; impure inclination is termed ' attachment' (sanga)" That is, she is free from contact with ignorance; because of the non-existence of ignorance, which is pure illusion. Essentially saying that in Her higher nature the Divine Mother is unaffected by Maya/Avidhya/Ignorance and in facts wields it as her power to manifest this creation.  For the fans of Gita you will notice this being said in many places.
