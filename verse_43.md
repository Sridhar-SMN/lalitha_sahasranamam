## 126. शाङ्करी - Shankari - Sep 18 

Wife of Saṇkarā, a form of Siva, is known as Sāṃkarī. Śam means happiness and karā means doer. Therefore Saṇkarā is known to give happiness and his wife Śāṇakarī has the same quality. Siva and Saktī do not have any difference in "qualities" between them (have to be careful to understand this as Ishwara Anugraham based on the laws of nature and not that Gods have qualities like humans/jivas). That is why Śiva and Pārvatī are said to be father and mother of the universe. 

The famous poem of Kalidasa in रघुवम्श/raghuvamsha is used to describe this concept of Siva and Parvathi as parents of this Universe and is figuratively represented in the form of Ardhanareeshwarar. 

वागर्थाविव सम्पृक्तौ वागर्थ प्रतिपत्तये ।जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ॥ 
vaagarthaaviva sampRuktau vaagartha pratipattaye | jagataH pitarau vande paarvatIparameshvarau ||

We will see more of this in the namas on Prakriti, Maya etc and Lord Krishna borrows this concept in Chap 9 (9.17) and Chap 13 (13.19-13.23) in the Gita.  More on this later. 

## 127. श्रीकरी - Srikari - Sep 19 

We saw in Nama # 1 that "Sri" as a prefix means greatness.  In this context Srī means all types of prosperity. It also means wealth, happiness, beauty, attraction, auspiciousness, etc. Since She is the embodiment of all these qualities and also endows these qualities on Her devotees, She is known as Śrīkarī. 

Vishnu Saharanamam nama 611 is Śrīkarā which means the giver of wealth to His devotees. And it is here we need to pay attention to Shankaracharya's commentary on that nama in VS which is equally applicable here. He explains the nama as "conferor of Sri on those devotees that remember, praise & worship Him". We saw in nama #120 on Sep 11 the meaning of "my devotee - madh baktha" . pls link that here. 

"Conferor of Sri" means what ?  For this we need to go to the previous nama in VS which is "Sridharah" and Shankaracharya explains this as "The bearer of Sri - He keeps on his chest Goddess Lakshmi, the mother of all" - in effect the supporter of all prosperities. But Shankaracharya will be disappointed if we equate Lakshmi or Lalithambike with material prosperity -  At the end of his prayer to Goddess Lakshmi in Kanakadhara Stotram the final plea that Shankarar chants is so beautiful 

dēvi prasīda jagadīśvari lōkamātaḥ
kalyāṇadātri kamalēkṣaṇajīvanāthē |
dāridryabhītihr̥dayaṁ śaraṇāgataṁ mām
ālōkaya pratidinaṁ sadayairapāṅgaiḥ

Want to draw your attention to the 3rd part - dāridryabhītihr̥dayaṁ śaraṇāgataṁ mām - here Shankarar says he is not surrendering to obtain wealth/money/gold & relief from material poverty  but relief he is seeking is from the poverty that is afflicting the mind - the poverty caused by ignorance of our true nature. 


## 128. साध्वी - Sadhvi - Sep 20

The nama refers to the purity and chastity, however not how we typically understand but chaste thru knowledge. Lalithambike is called as chaste because, She always remains with Śiva. And as we saw earlier the nama Shiva/Siva represents true knowledge/bliss/ananda.  She considers Śiva as pati deva just as a wife who regards her husband as divine and vice verse. This is the right explanation for this nāma as She was 'created' by Śiva and therefore She considers Śiva as Her divine husband. ‘Pati vedanaḥ’ means Śiva. For Tamil speakers pls dont crack up here - It is Vedanah not Vedanai-வேதனை (for non tamil speakers வேதனை means worry :-)) . Vedanaḥ means perception or knowledge and pati vedanaḥ means possessor of knowledge.

Taking Śiva as nirguṇa Brahman or the Brahman without attributes and his consort (Maya sakthi)  is Nirguna Brahman+Maya Sakthi = Saguṇa Brahman, as She is endowed with all the energies for creation,sustenance and dissolution.

## 129. शरच्चन्द्र-निभानना - sarachandra nibhanana - Sep 21 

Her face appears like the moon in spring season. Sarad means second half of October, November and first half of December. In a natural horoscope, each rāśi represents a solar month. Two solar months make a ṛtu and six ṛtu-s make a year. During śarad ṛtu (autumn or fall season) the moon appears brighter and without blemishes.  I personally think the LS is moving towards the Nirguna Svarupam which starts soon. Namas 132 to 155 discuss Her as Nirguṇa Brahman or Her formless form. Worshipping Her as Nirguṇa (without attributes or qualities) form is considered as an important aspect of worship and the result of such worship is described in namas 156 to 195.

## 130. शातोदरी - Shatodari - Sep 21 

She has thin waist. These two namass (129 and 130) are connected to Her kāmakalā form, the details of which will be discussed in kāmakalā rūpā (nāma 322)
