Wife of Saṇkarā, a form of Siva, is known as Sāṃkarī. Śam means happiness and karā means doer. Therefore Saṇkarā is known to give happiness and his wife Śāṇakarī has the same quality. Siva and Saktī do not have any difference in "qualities" between them (have to be careful to understand this as Ishwara Anugraham based on the laws of nature and not that Gods have qualities like humans/jivas). That is why Śiva and Pārvatī are said to be father and mother of the universe. 

The famous poem of Kalidasa in रघुवम्श/raghuvamsha is used to describe this concept and is figuratively represented as the form of Ardhanareeshwarar. 

वागर्थाविव सम्पृक्तौ वागर्थ प्रतिपत्तये ।जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ॥ 
vaagarthaaviva sampRuktau vaagartha pratipattaye | jagataH pitarau vande paarvatIparameshvarau ||

Śrī means all types of prosperity. It also means wealth, happiness, beauty, attraction, auspiciousness, etc. Since She is the embodiment of all these qualities and also endows these qualities on Her devotees, She is known as Śrīkarī. Viṣṇu Sahasranāma 611 is Śrīkarā which means the giver of wealth to His devotees. In fact, there is no difference between Viṣṇu and Lalitāmbikā.
