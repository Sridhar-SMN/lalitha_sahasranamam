She is wearing a nose stud that outshines the stars. Her nose stud is made up of rubies and pearls. Tārā means stars Tārā also means two goddesses Maṅgalā and Śuklā. Śuklā has later come to be known as Śukrā. Possibly these Maṅgalā and Śukrā could mean the two planets Mars and Venus. Each planet governs certain precious stones. Planet Mars rules ruby that is red in colour and Venus rules diamond . It can also be said that these two planets adorn Her nose. This also indicates that worshipping Her wards off the evil effects of planets.
