## नवचम्पक-पुष्पाभ-नासादण्ड-विराजिता  : navacampaka-puṣpābha-nāsādaṇḍa-virājitā

Her nose resembles like a newly blossomed champaka flower. 

## ताराकान्ति-तिरस्कारि-नासाभरण-भासुरा : tārākānti-tiraskāri-nāsābharaṇa-bhāsurā

She is wearing a nose stud that outshines the stars. Her nose stud is made up of rubies and pearls. Tārā means stars Tārā also means two goddesses Maṅgalā and Śuklā. Śuklā has later come to be known as Śukrā. Possibly these Maṅgalā and Śukrā could mean the two planets Mars and Venus. Each planet governs certain precious stones. Planet Mars rules ruby that is red in colour and Venus rules diamond . It can also be said that these two planets adorn Her nose. This also indicates that worshipping Her wards off the evil effects of planets.


## Addendum

In nama 20 there is a word "तिरस्कारि". During a reading today saw this interesting explanation to the word - we had originally captured it as "wards of evil effects of planets" but there is also a deeper meaning as you can see below.

The Sanskrit word tiraskāre, which I am rendering as “drives away,” does not mean he totally ignores this differentiated perception. Here, “drives away” indicates that he ignores it through the mind (and is able to see the same reality in every perception / object as explained by Lord in Gita 4.24). Although internally he does everything that other individuals do, he is not attached to those differentiated perceptions. So, although he lives in these differentiated perceptions, the nature of his God consciousness shines forth and these perceptions subside and along with it raaga/dwesha (likes/dislkes)
